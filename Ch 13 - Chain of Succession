<h1>Chapter 13 - Chain of Succession</h1>
<h2>The Gooding Interlude</h2>
By the end of the last century, Tek's thinking finally fell in line with Soros. Meyers had been running the numbers each year through the 90s to see if more value was wrung out of the company by keeping it together or splitting it apart. By the end of that last decade, with Printers growing, and VND and the group cratering, the time had come. Tektronix divested its printing, video and networking divisions. The printing business was sold to Xerox. Tek itself went back to concentration on its test equipment roots.

It sold the video business to a private investor, Terence Gooding of San Diego, California, who reincorporated it under the name Grass Valley Group, Inc. The sale closed on September 24, 1999. Gooding was a private investor based in San Diego. Tektronix kept a 10% equity stake in the new venture, which continued to be based in Nevada City, with an engineering design center inherited from Tektronix in Beaverton, Ore. While Tek had dropped the "Group" from the name a few years prior, Gooding added the moniker back, so the company again was the Grass Valley Group. Besides the traditional switcher and router markets the Group kept the Profile server group up in Oregon.

The investor group led by Gooding, included Thorsteinson, who moved over to the new venture from Tek. Gooding served as chairman and Thorsteinson as CEO of Grass Valley Group. Larry Neitling continued on as the Operations Manager. With an additional Lazard Asset Management Group investment of $34M in capital, Gooding and investment partners promised to fund the new company's working capital and acquisition needs until it reached a level of fiscal maturity appropriate for outside funding. They eventually pumped $100M into the R&D effort.

The new company had annual sales of $200 million in 2000 with 700 employees worldwide. To help build the company it tried focusing not only on television broadcasting, but emerging markets, such as the Internet to electronic projection, as well, with little effect

Thorsteinson had three goals for the new company:
• A narrower focus on its strengths, namely the video server area where GVG's Profile maintained the its number one market share, as well as Grass Valley switchers, routers, and modular products. Over the preceding several years, Tek had tried its hands at PCs and nonlinear editing systems, but found the market to be saturated and unresponsive.
• Reducing costs, GVG consolidated from three manufacturing plants to its Providence Mine operation in Nevada City, reducing costs from $45 million per quarter to $19 million per quarter.
• Competitive pricing, including using commodity microprocessors to reduce manufacturing costs.

While the company was resting on the success of its Profile servers and its well-known switchers, but in a rapidly changing broadcast landscape, it gave them a little breathing room as it was again becoming competitive in its core products. The consolidation back to home turf was to last only for a couple years. The expansion away from the Grass Valley area was soon to begin in earnest.

When Goodman took over the Group, revenues from new products introduced within the previous 12 months represented less than 10% of Tek's VND division revenues, as most of the products selling had been introduced 5 or 6 years ago. "If you don't offer new products every 18 to 24 months, you won't succeed in this business." Thorsteinson said at the time.

As Tek was selling the Group, it was launching a new production switcher, the Kalypso. OB operators loved it, as it had many new innovations for high end production. Launched at IBC in 1999, it took the switcher concept another quantum leap forward, becoming what the Group called the "video production center," putting still stores (and later clip stores) and graphics file conversion right into the switcher, along with multiple effects banks and other creative power.

Thorsteinson and the group were taking additional action. They invested $60 million in research and development in 24 months to develop new products. The plan was to continue spending 13% to 15% of sales on research and development, which would have been $30 to $35 million annually on R&D.

In the router realm the company, in 2000, introduced the 7500 wideband routing system. Early on with HD reclockers for the signal did not work very well. The answer early on was to just build routers with as wide a bandwidth as possible. The 7500 could work with signals ranging from 10 KB/s to 1.485 GB/s HD bit rate.

They also tried marketing the Voodoo Media Recorder. With 32 heads, this SMPTE D6 gigabit recorder could record either uncompressed HD or data streams up to 128 MB/s. While impressive, it was very expensive due to the speeds, and the space that uncompressed media data required. It was a bit a head of its time technology wise.

Avstar was launched, which was a joint newsroom automation project between Avid and GVG. The Group contributed their Newstar product to the effort, and while at the time Gooding said that it "remains an important part of the company's business," he also said that GVG will rely less on joint ventures moving forward. "It takes so much work to do a joint venture." He decided to sell off their Newstar product line to Avid 2001.

In 2001 the GXF container format (informally, sometimes called a wrapper) or metafile was introduced. This was a file format that allows multiple data streams to be embedded into a single file, usually along with metadata for identifying and further detailing those streams. Grass Valley had started development on it for their Profile servers. SMPTE formalized the standard as SMPTE360M as a broadcast industry audio/video file interchange format based on Profile video servers.

The company continued Profile development by introducing the Profile Media Area Network, which provided shared storage for up to 48 channels. This allowed truly enterprise wide storage and delivery.

Under Gooding and Thorsteinson the Zodiak digital production switcher was introduced in 2001 for mid range applications. It was an effort to replicate its analog market share in live digital production, which offered many of the high end features of the company's flagship Kalypso Digital Production System but carried a smaller $125,000 price tag verses Kalypso's starting price of $185,000. Affordability was a major factor that had made the analog GVG model 200 and 250 the veritable workhorses of the industry. The company was hoping to replicate that in the digital realm. But again, these were SD switchers, and not HD.

Thomson came a calling in 2002. It was looking to bulk up it's offerings in the media arena. This wouldn't be the only time that Grass Valley was acquired with that object in mind. Thomson payed $172 million. The changes that Tek had contemplated for the Group were mild for what was soon to happen. This was the second time that Thorsteinson was involved with selling the same company. It wouldn't be the last.

<h2>Thomson's Turn</h2>
In April 2002, the French electronics giant Thomson Multimedia, today known as Technicolor SA, became the third owner of the Grass Valley Group. Combined the two companies were $500 million a year concern.

Under Thomson, Tim Thorsteinson, the former president and CEO of Grass Valley Group, became the vice president of the combined switcher, server, digital news production, router, master control, facility control and modular product lines. Thorsteinson, who has made his reputation on his commitment to R&D, at the time said the new R&D team would be split between Europe and the U.S. He said working from two continents does have its advantages. "There's always a feature set that our guys didn't quite get for the production switchers, or we did big routers when Europe was going to compact routers," he said. "Having a design presence in a geography and having people visit customers there is a tremendous advantage."

Thomson had already enlarged its broadcast activities earlier that year when it acquired a majority interest in the Philips Professional Broadcast Group. Thomson thought the transaction would reinforce Thomson's access to the professional U.S. customer base. At the time of the sale Thorsteinson said, "Our goal is to take the things we've been successful at and carry them forward, and the upside of this whole acquisition is that we're now part of a company that is focused on the total media space and we're part of a large company that has a capital base. The challenge of what we've been doing the last couple of years is that we've been very thinly capitalized. So keeping the engineering spending where we kept it, 15-20% per year when we're in an industry recession and we're capitalized by basically one person was difficult." None–the–less Thorsteinson was soon gone, but his influence on the company was not done.

After coming under the ownership of Thomson, Grass Valley Group was forced to merge its product line with the existing professional and broadcast products of its new parent company, with mixed results. This is when the vast majority of the corporate DNA, today infused behind the Grass Valley moniker, occurred as we will see. While it was known as Thomson–Grass Valley then, a lot of the assets, and baggage that Thomson brought stayed under the Grass Valley name when the company was sold later for the 4th time.

<h3>Thomson's Ancestry</h3>
The lineage of Thomson is the convergence of five lines of companies. We will look at them now.

<h4>Thomson</h4>
Thomson was named after the electrical engineer Elihu Thomson, who was born in Manchester, England, on March 26, 1853. Thomson moved to Philadelphia, USA, at the age of 5, with his family. Thomson formed the Thomson–Houston Electric Company in 1879 with Edwin Houston. The company merged with the Edison General Electric Company to become the General Electric Company in 1892. In 1893, the Compagnie Franċaise Thomson-Houston (CFTH) was formed in Paris, a sister company to GE in the United States. It was from this company that the modern Thomson Group would evolve.

Thomson was early to digital, producing their first Digital Noise Reducer in 1977. In 1986 Thomson demonstrated Le Studio Numerique, the world's 1st full component digital studio. Later the system was installed at SFP, Paris. In 1992 Thomson introduced a Motion Compensated Standards Converter.

Hi powered television transmitter

Thomson-CSF acquired U.S. transmitter vendor Comark Communications, along with Comwave and formed Thomcast Communications to strengthen their worldwide presence in television transmitters. In the late 80s Comark was known for pioneering very high power television transmitters, using an off spring of the Klystron vacuum tubes which were much more efficient than their ancestors. Comark was selected to supply the transmitter system for the Model HDTV station Project.

In the early 90s Thomcast added Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), a Swiss transmitter and antenna company to its transmitter portfolio. In 2000 Thomson–CSF divested its military and transmission product lines creating Thales. Thomcast becomes Thales Broadcast and Multimedia. (Confusing!) In 2003 Thales pioneered the development of Digital Modulator Pre–Correction for ATSC 8-VSB.

In June 1998 in a deal brokered by the French government, parts of Aerospatiale, Alcatel, and Dassault Industries came under the Thomson umbrella. The French State's interest in Thomson was reduced from 58% to 40%, and Alcatel and Dassault Industries became shareholders.

<h4>Bosch</h4>
https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/bosch.jpg

Bosch GmbH was founded in 1886 and made magneto ignition devices for gas turbines and later automobiles. It branched out into other auto parts and became an armaments supplier for Nazi Germany.

In 1939 Bosch took control of Fernseh, which started in 1929 as a television technology research firm on behalf of others. Fernseh is believed to have created the first remote television truck in 1932. Soon the combined company was known as Bosch Fernseh. In 1967 the combined company introduced its first color TV.

In 1975 it introduced what was known as a B-format VTR

By the 80s Bosch, besides still in the automotive parts business, the company had a full line of broadcast television equipment.

<h4>Bell & Howell</h4>

B&H 8mm film camera 

Bell & Howell was founded in 1907 by two projectionists to manufacture film cameras, lenses, and motion picture machinery. In 1954 KUTV signed on in Salt Lake City. In 1962 a joint venture between the station and the Salt Lake City Tribune, Telemation was founded. It developed and sold a line of industrial quality, not quite broadcast quality, television equipment. In 1971 they introduced their first color camera and followed with a color film chain in 1973. In 1974 they offered their first television router.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/telemation%20camera.jpg
Bell & Howell purchased the company in 1977. In 1979 they entered into a joint venture with the Bosch Fernseh Division. In 1982 Bosch fully acquired the venture renaming the company Robert Bosch Corporation Fernseh Division.

<h4>Philips</h4>
The Philips Company was founded in 1891, and its first products were lamps. In the 1920s, the company started to manufacture other products, such as vacuum tubes. In 1939, they introduced their electric razor, the Philipshave which was marketed in the US using the Norelco brand name. What Philip became very well known for in the broadcast industry was their cameras. Their first big hit in the U.S. television market was their ground breaking PC-60 color camera which was introduced in 1964.

PC stood for Plumbicon Color. The "plumbicon" imaging tube was a much more sensitive, smaller, with higher resolution than what had come before. 60 stood for the year the Plumbicon was invented. In the U.S., the camera was also sold under the Norelco brand. Yes, the same folks who had been selling electric razors. An early pioneer in television, Philco, in 1940 claimed that Philips name was too similar to theirs, and got the FTC to block any products from having the Philips name on it in the U.S. So they set up a subsidiary called North American Electronics, or Norelco for short. So everywhere else except the U.S., when the Norelco PC-60 launched, it was known as the LDK-1. LDK is the Dutch abbreviation of the lead oxide tube, which is what comprised that image target in the plumbicon tube. Finally, in 1981 Philips acquired GTE, who had acquired Philco from Ford Motor. Ford had bought Philco in 1961. Philips could now brand itself Philips everywhere.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/abc%20pc-70.jpg
PC-70, which soon followed the PC-60. The camera that made ABC and CBS get serious about color

Up until then both networks were avoiding broadcasting much in color. ABC because it didn't have the money to spend on color equipment. Color cameras were going in the $100K range, in 1960s dollars. Plus all the ancillary equipment was also more expensive than black and white equipment.

CBS's reason was more strategic. While companies such as Marconi were offering color equipment, the dominant player by far was RCA. They had invented all electronic color and sold the vast majority of color gear at the time. RCA also owned NBC, which CBS deemed their major competitor. CBS was in no mood to indirectly help their competitor. While by 1960 NBC was for all intents a full color network, CBS had less than a dozen color cameras across the entire network. The rational that CBS used at the time was that they would provide color programs when the advertisers would pay for it. NBC had the luxury and rationale, a generation earlier than we saw with Sony, of producing shows in color to fuel color set sales. At that time RCA was the dominant home receiver manufacturer, along with being the dominant color production equipment supplier. Much like Sony was in the 80s and 90s.

CBS was so against having to buy color equipment that they fought RCA's efforts to standardize color on their system. They even designed a color system that used a spinning "color wheel" or disk as a competitor to RCA's all-electronic approach. Besides the mechanical attributes, it was a much simpler system electronically. The state of the art in electronics in the early 50s made the CBS approach much more stable. But while RCA's system would not obsolete existing black & white sets, CBS's would.

Much to CBS's dismay the FCC actually adopted the CBS system for a while. That was not CBS's end game. Their real motive was to stymie the RCA system. CBS's rationale was that they had just a few years earlier, during the late 40s, spent an awful lot on RCA black & white equipment, they did not relish having to do that all again on RCA color equipment. For a while they scambled to go into the color home receiver business. They were given an out by the start of the Korean War. Ostensibly by request of the National Production Authority "to conserve material for defense" for the duration of the Korean War. CBS announced, almost too quickly some thought, that it agreed and would also drop color broadcasts; color receivers were recalled and destroyed. Only a couple hundred were ever produced. Strangely, monochrome receiver production was not affected. RCA eventually perfected their system enough to release it for sale. Even then, the industry group that standardized RCA's system, the National Television Systems Committee, or NTSC, some claimed the initials actually stood for "Never Twice the Same Color!"

Philips had over 1000 of their state of the art cameras out in the field by 1968.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ldk-5-2.jpg
The PCP90 minicam was introduced in 1969, and the PC100, the first triax cable camera a year later. The first introduced a truly broadcast quality camera head that could be strapped to a person's back. The second one heralded the use of modified coax to connect the camera with the rest of its electronics, instead of fat multi-conductor cables.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/pye%20transmitter.jpg
https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/80s%20pye%20tv.jpg
In 1967 Philips acquired control of Pye Ltd, which was an electronics company founded in 1896 in Cambridge, England, as a manufacturer of scientific instruments. The company eventually offered a line of TV sets and television transmitters.

In 1975 their second generation of the LDK series of cameras was introduced. In 1979 the FDL 60 Telecine was introduced. It was the 1st telecine to use CCD sensors. Philip's LDK6, their first totally automatic camera was introduced at NAB in Dallas 1982.

Over the years Philips developed a number of firsts found today in high end cameras. These include "crispening" circuitry that sharpened the transitions in a video signal resulting in the appearance of a sharper picture. They also pioneered the selective application of such circuitry, by controlling the amount of sharpening that was added to flesh tones to hide wrinkles, which they developed in 1993. A big development came in 2000 when they created the HD-DPM imager technology for CCDs allowing for the first time a sensor to be set up for scanning in one of several native HD formats, a development we covered earlier.

<h4>BTS & Philips Broadcast</h4>
https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/BTS%20OB%20Van.jpg
BTS equipped OB van

In 1986 BTS, Inc. was formed as a joint venture between Bosch and Philips. The Robert Bosch Video Division, comprised of the Salt Lake manufacturing facility, acquired from Telemation, and a sister manufacturer in Germany were joined with a Philips television camera manufacturing facility in the Netherlands, to become Broadcast Television Systems or BTS, Inc. In 1992 BTS became a wholly owned member of the Philips family, retaining the BTS name. In 1992 parts of the Albertville Winter Olympics were covered in HDTV for the 1st time with HDTV OB vans and equipment from BTS.

In 1995 Philip re–branded BTS as Philips Broadcast. Philips Broadcast stayed a brand until 2001 when it was acquired by Thomson multimedia SA, merging the company with Thomson's own broadcast division into Thomson Broadcast and Media Solutions (TBMS) business group. The groups product lines among many other things included cameras, routers, switchers, and even VTRs.

<h4>Technicolor</h4>
In 2000, Thomson Multimedia purchased Technicolor for $2.1 billion from Carlton Television (owned by Carlton Communications) in the UK and began a move into the broadcast management, facilities and services market with the purchase of Corinthian Television, becoming Thomson Multimedia.

<h3>Bulking Up</h3>
Early on in his career the author had a boss who often said "If RCA doesn't make it, we don't need it!"

A common line uttered through the 60s as RCA sold the entire length of the television equipment food chain. At it's height RCA was like IBM and the Seven Dwarfs in the television realm. Interestingly RCA was one of the seven dwarfs in the computing realm at the time. During it's rein in television many wanted options other than RCA. The camera on the left sold briskly when it was introduced in the 1960s because it did not have RCA's logo on the side of it (yes it is the same model that had the ABC logo on it a bit earlier). CBS hated RCA so much (as they owned their largest rival - NBC), that they would pry RCA logos off the RCA equipment they were forced to buy. As mentioned a bit ago CBS originally fought the implementation of RCA' all electronic color television, so as not to have to buy more equipment from them.

Interestingly in 1988, 2 years after General Electric Company bought RCA, they sold their consumer electronics division, to Thomson-CSF, in exchange for some of Thomson's medical businesses. At one time it held the RCA trademark rights.

With the addition of Grass Valley in 2002, this was to be RCA Broadcast for the new century, to offer products from cameras to transmit antennas under one umbrella. Only RCA was able to accomplish that until GE bought them in 86 and dismantled them. Thomson had managed to roll up a dozen companies into its consortium. But the conglomerate was not done.

Thomson then purchased the Moving Picture Company from ITV and the Internet startup Singingfish, but then sold it to AOL in late 2004.

In 2004 Parkervision, Jacksonville, Florida company was bought for $14 million, adding automated news production systems and robotic camera lines. This added 143 employees to the company which then had over 73,000 worldwide employees. What Parkervision offered to it's clientele was the ability to run a production control room, say during a newscast, with one employee instead of the four or five normal required in a mid–sized market.

In 2004, Thomson set up a joint venture with China's TCL (TTE), giving to TCL all manufacturing of RCA and Thomson television and DVD products. This made TCL the global leader in TV manufacturing, while Thomson still controlled the brands and licensed them to TTE. At the time, TCL was hailed as the first Chinese company to compete on the international stage with large international corporations. Thomson initially retained all marketing of TTE's products, but transferred that to TTE a year later. Thomson sold the Indian company, Videocon Group, the display manufacturing business for about $250 million. In early 2010, Thomson sold the television brand RCA to ON Corporation.

Next on the menu was Canopus Co., a manufacturer of video editing cards and video editing software, which was acquired in 2005 for $107 million. The company's video cards had competed with the likes of Matrox and Pinnacle Systems. In 2003 Canopus introduced their EDIUS nonlinear editing software.

In its quest to cast as wide a net as possible in product offerings, at the end of 2005 it also bought back Thales Broadcast for $155.6 million, which it had sold off earlier. This brought a line of radio and TV transmitters, antennas, and a line of MPEG test equipment into the fold. It also added Nextstream, with compression product lines for telco, cable, and satellite segments.

Together, these acquisitions completed Thomson's two year plan to enhance its claim as "a worldwide leader in end to end systems for distributing multimedia content over broadcast, cable, satellite, and the emerging market for sending video over Internet Protocol, also known as IPTV."

The problem was there were some product overlap. Both Grass Valley and Philips made production switchers and routers. In fact Grass Valley's Trinix router was introduced almost at the same time that Philip was developing their venerable line of Venus routers. Also, both Philips and Thomson offered high end cameras.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/valentin.jpg
Marc Valentin became the Grass Valley's Division president, replacing Thorsteinson.

Valentin started with Thomson in 1993 as a corporate planner. In 97 he became Chief of Staff which meant the managing and organizing of Thomson CEO's presentations, management meetings and management schedule, then moved on to be Vice–President, Digital set–top–boxes Europe. In 2002 he became head of the entire company, which interestingly was now called Grass Valley. He was tasked with integrating the former Philips Broadcast business and Grass Valley Group into the rest of the company.

When Thomson had taken over the company it became known as Grass Valley, a Thomson brand. By 2005 Thomson realized that the Grass Valley brand was stronger than Thomson's, at least in the professional television realm in the states. So the Grass Valley brand was applied to all activities of the division, including the website; www.thomsongrassvalley.com became www.grassvalley.com. All traffic to the former web site was now automatically directed to the new site. While the brand name was as strong as ever, with much expanded product lines, the namesake of the company was losing its grip on the company.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/grass_valley_kayak_hd.jpg
In 2003 the first joint switcher project between Philips and GV design teams produced the KayakDD Digital production switcher for low to mid–range markets, with many features of the Zodiak.

In 2005 Premier Retail Networks (PRN) was acquired by Thomson for $285 million. The company did digital sign–age for companies such as WalMart. Also in 2005, what many said would never happen, that is up until the Thomson acquisition, a Grass Valley product with a lens hung on the front of it. A Thomson-Grass Valley camera was introduced at IBC.

In 2006 the Grass Valley Division teamed with Polatis which was a provider of optical switching products for the communications, video, defense and instrumentation industries in an attempt to re–enter the fiber market.

In 2007 the "French conglomerate" as it was often referred to, decided to replace Valentin with Jacques Dunoguè, and realign the structure of the business. Dunoguè was the Senior Executive Vice President in charge of Thomson's Systems Division. At the same time steps to strengthen and reinforce video networking and systems integration synergies with Thomson's other related businesses were also taken. Grass Valley, with Philips firmly under the GV brand, were organized into three business units: Broadcast & Professional Solutions, Integration & Transmission Solutions, and Video Network Solutions. At that time Jeff Rosica, who had been managing Grass Valley's North American sales and marketing efforts, continued on in that role and also lead the Broadcast & Professional Solutions business unit, reporting directly to Dunoguè.

<h3>The implosion</h3>
In 2008 the housing bubble broke, culminating into a "perfect storm" that became known as the Great Recession. Up until Covid19, it was considered by many economists to have been the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. It was a worldwide recession.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/foreclosure.jpg

It was precipitated by predatory lending targeting low–income home buyers, and a vast web of derivatives linked to Mortgage–backed securities, tied to American real estate, which collapsed in value. The increase in cash out refinancing, as home values rose, fueled an increase in consumption that could no longer be sustained when home prices went into decline. The U.S. home mortgage debt relative to GDP increased from an average of 46% during the 1990s to 73% during 2008.

U.S. mortgage debt was at $10.5 trillion. In March 2008, the Federal Reserve allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in subprime mortgages from banks. Officials thought this would contain the possible crisis. But the U.S. dollar weakened, and commodity prices soared.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/bear%20stearns.jpg

Global financial institutions started failing. Also Bear Stearns, with $46 billion of mortgage assets that had not been written down and $10 trillion in total assets, faced bankruptcy. The Federal reserve held its first emergency meeting in 30 years, the Federal Reserve agreed to guarantee Bear Sterns bad loans to facilitate its acquisition by JPMorgan Chase in a fire sale. Stearns stock had fallen from $178/share a year earlier to $60/share. Chase bought it at $10/share.

In late June 2008 the U.S. stock market had fallen 20% from its highs, and commodity-related stocks soared as oil traded above $140/barrel for the first time and steel prices rose above $1,000 per ton.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/lehman%20brothers.jpg

Financial institutions worldwide continued to suffer severe damage. This reached a climax with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. The Federal Reserve declined to guarantee its loans as it did for Bear Stearns. The Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States, led the exodus of most of its clients, drastic losses in its stock, and devaluation of assets by credit rating agencies, largely sparked by a loss of confidence, Lehman's involvement in the sub–prime mortgage crisis, and its exposure to less liquid assets. Lehman's bankruptcy filing was the largest in US history.

Barclay acquired what was left of Lehman's North America operations for $1.35 billion. What it basically got was its $960-million headquarters, a 38-story office building in Midtown Manhattan, and the responsibility for 9,000 former employees severance pay.

To avoid bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America for $50 billion in a transaction facilitated by the U.S. government.

In what continued to be a bad September, the Federal Reserve took over American International Group with $180 billion in debt and equity funding, and technically assumed control, because many believed its failure would endanger the financial integrity of other major firms that were its trading partners. These were Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Merrill Lynch, as well as dozens of European banks.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/financial%20crash.jpg

Next, the equivalent of a bank run on money market funds, investors withdrew $144 billion from U.S. money market funds, which frequently invest in commercial paper issued by corporations to fund their operations and payrolls, causing the short–term lending market to freeze. The withdrawal compared to $7.1 billion in withdrawals the week prior. This interrupted the ability of corporations to rollover their short–term debt. The U.S. government extended insurance for money market accounts analogous to bank deposit insurance via a temporary guarantee and with Federal Reserve programs to purchase commercial paper. By the end of the year the DJIA had dropped another 20%.

The banking crisis spread. Iceland saw all three of its major banks fail. Relative to the size of its economy, it was the largest economic collapse suffered by any country in history. It was also followed by the European debt crisis, which began with a deficit in Greece in late 2009. The ongoing crisis saw $2 trillion erased from the global economy.

The credit crunch wreaked havoc with the paid advertising model for "Free" TV. Station Groups like Sinclair developed consolidation strategies based on centralized operations. The number of separate station owners was decreasing, and thus the equipment they needed was also decreasing. While the station groups total budget for broadcast equipment might have been increasing, the per station spending was declining because of consolidation of ownership groups.

Recent FCC decisions also accelerated this trend, such as ending the Main Studio Rule in 2017. The main studio rule had been in place for nearly 80 years and required AM, FM, and TV stations to have a main studio located in or near the community it was licensed to. At the time, the rule was meant to facilitate input from community members and the station's participation in community activities.

The FCC, in its official announcement, said that it recognized that the public can now access information via broadcaster's online public file and that stations and community members can interact directly through alternative means such as email, social media and the telephone, making the main studio rule "outdated and unnecessarily burdensome." This meant that these ownership groups could consolidate their operations even more, reducing overall spending.

Technology is a great equalizer. It simultaneously erodes and creates wealth. The effect of technology on the Broadcaster has recently been to greatly reduce, if not remove, the power of the broadcaster to control the format in the home. Now the consumer consumes television on a device and format, and at the time of their choosing.

Thomson had revenues of $6.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008, a decrease of 12.7 percent compared to the previous year at then current exchange rates, and 7.7 on a constant currency basis. The crises resulted in Thomson defaulting on its financial covenants. Some of the company's private placements required that debt didn't exceed net worth. At the end of 2008 it had a market cap in France of around $460 million. Debt was nearly $2.8 billion. It had a little over $1 billion in cash at the end of the year; money it drew down from the balance remaining on its syndicated credit facility. By the end of April 2009, this covenant was going to be breached.

This triggered some creditors to demand early repayment. Thomson was forced by its creditors to divest its Grass Valley, and PRN digital signage business and other manufacturing entities. On January 29, 2009, Thomson announced the sales of the two divisions. Its stated reason was to focus on services business and improve its financial position. Together, Grass and PRN generated $1.3 billion in sales in 2008, about 20 percent of Thomson's revenues.

At the time the publication TV Technology observed: "Nothing against the French, but that ownership always seemed rocky. From my discussions with many Grass Valley personnel, the relationship between American and Technicolor's (Thomson's) French management was often strained. I more fully recognized one key symbol of the French style of management when GV press releases began listing the value of equipment sales in euros. I asked the Americans why a sale of equipment made in Grass Valley, CA, to a broadcast network in New York would be valued in euros. The paraphrased answer was, 'Because that's what they (the French) want.'"

On January 27, 2010, Thomson changed its name to Technicolor SA, re-branding the entire company after its US film technology subsidiary. Thomson's US subsidiary became Technicolor USA, Inc. Grass Valley went in July 2010 to the Francisco Partners and PRN that December. It also sold off it's transmission business. Thomson had sold the Grass Valley digital film transfer gear business, inherited from Technicolor to private equity investors in October of the year before.

One of several cameras used to film the Oz scenes. Invented in 1932, the Technicolor camera recorded on three separate negatives, red, blue and green, which were then combined to develop a full-color positive print. The box encasing the camera, a "blimp," muffled the machine's sound during filming.

An iconic name in the cinematographic industry, Technicolor was associated with the color process used widely in many celebrated films over three decades including "The Wizard of Oz," "Singin' in the Rain" and "Fantasia." For years, the company had been quietly transforming itself from a film–focused lab to a company providing all manner of digital services, including cinematographic digital processing and visual effects.

Like it did with Grass Valley, Thomson originally wanted to stress its own brand over Technicolor's, Thomson Technicolor, which diluted the value and meaning of the Technicolor name. The re–branding of the parent company and the refocusing of Technicolor on its heritage and not Thomson's represented a bold move on where the company thought its future lie. Also, getting rid of a too cumbersome past was certainly a consideration. Chief marketing officer Ah-mad Ouri said at the time "We chose the Technicolor name because it's most relevant to content creators and distributors." In a sign that the center of the company was shifting to Hollywood, Quri was based there. The company's new headquarters was at Sunset-Gower Studios

Technicolor's historic core competency has been in color science, be it it's original giant three-strip film cameras and film processing, is today extended into the video digital realm, as film is no more. What once ended up on film is now a digital bitstream, a "number sequence" to digital signal processing purists.
