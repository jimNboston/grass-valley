h1>Chapter 15 - The Fairchild Effect</h1>
<h2>"We started it all!"</h2>

Once the first tree takes root, and firmly entrenches itself into the landscape, it does what biology naturally intended, it produces other trees in its vicinity. The same happened with Grass Valley. While the company itself only once formally shed a piece of itself to stand alone, NVISION, it produced many acorns, so-to-speak, that fell out of the company and germinated.

Some were born entrepreneurs, others accidentally became one, and some were forced to due to circumstances. It might be that they see a solution where others don't even see a problem. They see the faintest glow of light at the end of a tunnel, where most see cavernous dark.

Some were born entrepreneurs, others accidentally become one, and some were forced to due to circumstances. It might be that they see a solution where others don't even see a problem. They see the faintest glow of light at the end of a tunnel, where most see cavernous dark. But that's only part of the necessary attributes to go act upon their insight. They are passionate, but not so blind as to not seek help and guidance when required, and setbacks just creates more zeal for eventual success.

According to Sherman Fairchild, who we looked at briefly earlier, Noyce's impassioned presentation of his vision for a new semiconductor company in 1957 was the reason Fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the infamous traitorous eight. William Shockley had started Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in 1956 in Mountain View, California. He was developing faster transistors. He hired a group of newly minted electrical engineers that were considered very bright, after his original plan to entice some of his former colleagues from Bell Labs, but none were willing to move to the West Coast.

Shockley was effective as a recruiter, but the engineering staff he had hired did not like his management style. Eight of those engineers, the traitorous eight, became unhappy with his management of the company. They turned to Fairchild Camera and Instrument, back in New York to fund their ideas. Fairchild set up the Fairchild Semiconductor division. Their big idea was to make silicon transistors at a time when germanium was still the most common material for semiconductor use. Since the silicon used mainly consists of sand and a few fine wires, the major cost would be in the manufacturing process. Noyce believed that transistors would become so cheap that electronic devices would be discarded instead of being repaired if broken. A view a few decades ahead of its time. Noyce would later go on to co-found Intel.

In 1958 they had their first transistor for sale, the $150 2N697. It was mainly used for defense applications. At the same time, Jean Hoerni, another of the 8, developed the planar process which was a major improvement. Since this process would allow transistors to be made more easily, their cost dropped dramatically, and they had greater performance and reliability. Early on in our story we mentioned that Charles Litton, the genesis of high tech in the Grass Valley area, helped Fairchild with this process.

The planar process made most other transistor processes obsolete. This led to the 2N1613, whose design Fairchild licensed across the industry. While Texas Instruments had created the first germanium based IC in 1958, in 1960 Fairchild had produced the first silicon based IC, which was a four transistor device. In fairly short order the original 12 employees grew to over 12,000, and the company was making north of $10 million a year.

In the early 60s Fairchild innovated with MOS technology. They also became a major player in analog circuitry, namely with the " op amp. " By 1965 Fairchild was the only profitable semiconductor manufacturer in the United States. But when it came to digital circuits they mis-stepped. They were slow to move from RTL, to DTL, to TTL logic devices.

While Fairchild Semiconductor made the majority of money for the parent company, in 1967 profits dropped significantly. Noyce had been made Vice President of the division earlier, effectively running the division. As a result of the financial hit, the parent company was in the market for a new president. It became clear to Noyce that it would not be him. Noyce decided to move on, and discreetly planned a new company with Gordon Moore, the head of R&D. They left Fairchild to found Intel in 1968. They were soon followed by other Fairchild alumni, Andrew Grove and Leslie L. VadÃ¡sz. Grove and VadÃ¡sz brought with them the radically new MOS Silicon Gate Technology. This was recently created in the Fairchild R&D Laboratory but did not appreciate the new technology at the time.

Eventually Fairchild hired a president who came from Motorola. Much like when McDonnell Douglas management invaded and took over from Boeing management in 1997 when Boeing was the technically the buyer, Motorola did a similar thing at Fairchild, enticing nearly a hundred to join the ranks. By the end of the 60s most of the original founders had left the company. The company became adrift, and never found its way back to the pioneer it was. In 1979 Fairchild Camera and Instrument was purchased by Schlumberger Limited, an oil field services company, for $425 million.

Schlumberger sold Fairchild to National Semiconductor in 1987 for $200 million. In 1997 National spun back out a rebirth of Fairchild, now headquartered in the east, no longer a " Silicon Valley" company.s only part of the necessary attributes to go act upon their insight. They are passionate, but not so blind as to not seek help and guidance when required, and setbacks just creates more zeal for eventual success.

<h2>Silicon Valley</h2>
Places like Silicon Valley loves to shrug off perfectly good reasons why an idea won't succeed. People there often find a premise that on the surface appears unsolvable. Often Startups that find answers to fundamental questions that most see as settled, can shoot out of the gates and scale before others catch on. Once in a while good ideas that look like bad ones often get a head start and end up with a dominant market share.

It is frequently outsiders, those encamped in high tech centers that are willing to challenge assumptions guarded by industry norms. Their naÃ¯vetè about what cannot be done is an asset. Dominant companies in their industries far from these centers can find that some far away upstart, who was never in their industry, has suddenly "eaten their lunch. " Founders of Uber, PayPal and Google were outsiders, but these companies have revolutionized the transportation, payments, and advertisement industries, respectively. Chuck Meyer, long time area insider, said that at one time you could pick an industry in the 80s, take one of its products, add a microprocessor, and voilà, you are in a new market. While that was true in the personal computer era that started in the 70s, and even more so as microprocessors and networking grew ever more sophisticated in the 80s, by the 90s, when the Internet era spanned forth everywhere, the big new "things" in innovation was moving to the "cloud. "

Meyer saw that before most, and he has led the Grass Valley Company's efforts in that regard. Today you disrupt an industry by moving it to the web. So since the turn of the century technology moved onto mobile devices, and into the app and social media eras. Exactly what the three big companies mentioned in the previous paragraph did.

Entrepreneurs often must "trust their gut". That means there are true things that cannot be articulated. But the dichotomy of a successful entrepreneur is being skeptical of their biases, which means knowing that they can confidently articulate things that aren't true. A corollary to the last sentence is that being contrarian requires taking a stance most people don't agree with. Being reasonable requires realizing that most people, as a group, are smarter than you. Many entrepreneurs realize that appearing "smart, " does not require the intellect of a rocket scientist. Is the ability to solve problems, and solving problems is the ability to get stuff done.

Way earlier in the book we saw this with the Group. Not to say that Dr. Hare and Bill Rorden were not brilliant, but they went in one week from Hare asking, " what the hell is a proc amp? " to a working model, in a case mind you. They got it done!

In the early days of Silicon Valley, Fairchild Semiconductor engineers would often help former colleagues turned competitors figure out problems. "We are all in it together" was the spirit of the day. Some others believed, "Good karma will come back. " That early thought played a large part in what became Silicon Valley. Steve Jobs once said that Robert Noyce helped him understand the "lay of the land" when he was starting Apple.

The are many companies in "Silicon Valley" that can trace its origin back to Fairchild include:
• National Semiconductor 1967 Santa Clara
Originally started by seven engineers from Sperry Rand Corporation in Danbury, Connecticut, in 1959. Peter Sprague purchased the company, and hired Charles Sporck, general manager of Fairchild, and a team of key manufacturing and marketing executives to reestablish the business in Santa Clara in 1967.

• Intel Corporation 1968 Mountain View
By Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce (both from Fairchild and Shockley)

• Advanced Micro devices 1960 Sunnyvale
By eight Fairchild Alumni

• Sequoia Capital 1972 Menlo Park
Founder was Don Valentine (Fairchild, National Semiconductor)
Early venture capital firm which invested in early stage technology companies that have included Apple, Cisco, Google, Nvidia, Oracle, PayPal, Stripe, YouTube, Instagram, Yahoo!, and WhatsApp and todaycontrol $1.4 trillion of combined stock market value.

• LSI Logic 1981 Milpitas
By five Fairchild Alumni, including former Fairchild CEO Wilfred Corrigan

• Linear Technology 1981 Milpitas
By five National Alumni (three of which also came through Fairchild), with funding from Sequoia.

• Altera 1983 San Jose
By three Fairchild Alumni and one from HP

<h3>Running a company - staying on top</h3>
Even in Silicon Valley many startups are ephemeral. People who create new and better products are often able to do so specifically because their thought process isn't restricted by norms that ground most people. But that same trait can make them counterproductive managers, because the "rules-don't-apply-to-me" mindset that's so effective when building a new product can be disastrous when managing people, especially as a company scales. Very talented engineers, designers, and product people can make very irrational HR and managerial decisions.

Scaling a company requires scaling HR, which is monstrously complex and usually unrelated to their original skill. Designing a device or discovering an investment strategy is a million miles separated from managing 500 or 1,000 people. Managing one-hundred thousand people is a different universe. Even when responsibilities are delegated, creating a culture that promotes trust, creativity, and growth is likely a totally different skill than was required to build your product in the first place. It's common that technical founders assume their ability to design a revolutionary product is linked with their ability to manage hundreds of people, when in fact those things can be miles apart. It is doubtful that Hare would have been able to manage his company as it grew ever larger.

The ability to learn faster and empathize with customers more than your competition. We saw this earlier with MySpace. The inability to understand how your customers experience your product almost guarantees an eventual drift between the problems a business tries to solve, and the problems customers need solved. Here again, a person with an average IQ who can empathize with customers will almost always beat someone with a higher IQ who can't put themselves in the customers' shoes.

Successful, professional managers of large companies understand they have two diametrically opposed targets. They must give their employees structure and oversight, while at the same time realizing that to keep those employees requires giving them freedom and autonomy. To accomplish this top management must maintain a certain level of paranoia in the company. Early on at the Group they had it in spades. Were they going to make the next payroll? What business should they really be in? That is part of what kept them focused, and eventually successful.

Many companies, like individuals, run their business based on goals. Some make the argument that it is better to manage a business based on systems, not goals. That is because once you reach a goal you tend to stop doing the thing that made achieving the goal possible. "We will always provide the best value to our customers" verses we will sell $10 million this quarter. Last chapter we looked at what might happen when goals become the target. Also as a company grows, if specific goals and metrics are imposed, they will constantly need to be tweaked.

<h2>Video Valley</h2>
The Grass Valley area naturally was tagged with the moniker, Video Valley. In this chapter we are going to trace how one video company started an ecosystem that allowed other â€œtreesâ€ to grow around it, and in some cases prompted others to locate into the area. Over 30 companies have sprung up, many by Group alumni. Others moved to the area to take advantage of the talent pool and ecosystem that sprang up. Other's setup outposts for clientele in the area. We will look at many of these companies in this chapter.

<h3>Cyan Engineering/Atari</h3>
<h4>Ampex Connection</h4>
An early addition to the tech community in the area was brought by a couple of Ampex Alumni out of the bay area. That was the company that first made video tape recording practicable. Even in the early 70s, the legendary rush hour gridlock in the San Francisco bay area, from San Jose northward, all the way to Santa Rosa, was in full display. Larry Emmons, an engineer for Ampex had had enough. He moved up to an area about 14 miles south of Grass Valley and started a consulting company. He was soon followed by Steve Mayer, who was another Ampex engineer. They started a company called Arvin Engineering in 1972.

They secured a contract with the Department of Defense to develop a video disk recorder. That project was soon canceled, and the two cast about for something else to do. For awhile they simply provided consulting services. Larry and Steve's boss at one time was Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell would go on to start Atari. This connection would forever link the Grass Valley area to video game lore.

At Ampex, Nolan Bushnell met fellow employee Ted Dabney and found they had common interests. Bushnell worked at a gaming arcade in college and developed a fascination with the electro-mechanical games of the time. Bushnell shared his ideas of creating pizza parlors filled with electronic games with Dabney. Bushnell took Dabney to the computing labs at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to show him Spacewar!. The game was developed in 1962 at MIT and was written to run on a DEC PDP-1 mini-computer. That computer could have up to 64K of magnetic core memory and a clock speed of around 200K. Quaint by todayâ€™s standards.

In 1971, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney founded a small engineering company, Syzygy Engineering with the intention of producing a Spacewar clone known as Computer Space, a game where the player shot at UFOs. They designed the game using their knowledge of video circuitry. It was not computer driven. While the first microprocessors were being introduced, the Intel 4004 4-bit microprocessor the year before, they were too expensive and underpowered. The use of analog video circuitry allowed the electronics to be much cheaper and smaller. Dabney built the prototype and Bushnell shopped it around, looking for a manufacturer. They made an agreement with Nutting Associates, a maker of coin-op trivia and shooting games, that produced a fiberglass cabinet for the unit that included a coin-slot mechanism.

Although sales of the game, which consisted of 1500 units totalling $3 million, it was considered a commercial failure. Bushnell laid the blame on Nutting, as Bushnell thought that they had not marketed the game very well. He decided that his next game would be licensed to a bigger manufacturer. Bushnell and Dabney worked for Nutting during that time, but he got Nutting to put a Syzygy Engineered label on each machine. Bushnell also knew that the next game they developed would need to be simpler and not require users to read instructions on the cabinet, since their target audience would likely be drunken bar patrons.

<h4>Arcade Games</h4>
They left Nutting and got funding from Bally Manufacturing to develop a new game. Bushnell and Dabney decided it was time to incorporate. Amazingly, Syzygy, an astronomical term, was already taken in the state of California. Bushnell was a fan of the board game "Go," and a term in the game was "Atari," which essentially in the context of the game meant what "check" meant in chess. On June 27, 1972, the two incorporated Atari, Inc. It actually means "to hit a target" in Japanese.

They hired their first design engineer, Al Alcorn, who was another Ampex alumni. At Cal Berkeley he participated in a work-study program that brought him to Ampex, where he worked under Bushnell. He graduated just as Bushnell was forming Atari.

After Bushnell attended a Burlingame, California demonstration of the Magnavox Odyssey, he gave the task of making the Magnavox tennis game into a coin-op version to Alcorn as a test project. He told Alcorn that he was making the game for General Electric, in order to motivate him, but in actuality he planned to simply dispose of the game, using it as a training episode for Alcorn. Bushnell's initial intention was to then move on to a car racing game, which would have been a tougher engineering design project. Bushnell thought that game would be more appealing than spaceship navigation to beer drinkers in a workingman's bar.

But the "warm up" project when completed seemed that it might have some appeal. Bushnell offered the finished design to Bally, who rejected it because the game required two players. Bushnell decided to build a prototype anyway and place it in a bar near them. That game was Pong. Atari released several sequels to Pong that built upon the originals game-play by adding new features. Not long after Pong's release Bushnell and Dabney had a falling-out. Bushnell ended up purchasing Dabney's share of Atari for $250,000 in 1973.

Atari was in the arcade gaming business, but they faced a problem with how that business operated. Local distributors of the games insisted on exclusive deals with suppliers. So in 1973, Atari secretly spawned a competitor called Kee Games, headed by Nolan's next door neighbor Joe Keenan, to sidestep pinball distributors' insistence on exclusive distribution deals. So both Atari and Kee could market virtually the same game to different distributors, each thinking they had an "exclusive" deal. Joe Keenan's management of the subsidiary led to him being promoted president of Atari that same year.

Soon after Pong's release, several companies began producing games that closely mimicked its game-play. Eventually, Atari's competitors released new types of video games that deviated from Pong's original format to varying degrees, and this, in turn, led Atari to encourage its small staff to move beyond Pong and produce more innovative games themselves. Bushnell knew that with Magnavox's Odyssey game taking off with consumers, he needed to move beyond arcade games. 'Screen Games' as Time magazine called them at the time, estimated that it was going to be a $900 Million a year business.

Bushnell discovered that his former colleagues at Cyan Engineering were looking for work, so in 1973 he offered Larry and Steve a contract to help Atari develop what eventually became known as the Atari VCS console. The company changed its name to Cyan Engineering. Interestingly it had relocated to the Litton building. Where the Grass Valley Company had gotten its start.

Bushnell knew he had to start moving in a new direction swiftly. Atari sold 8500 Pong machines and bought in $14 Million in 1974, but at the same time Pong sales were slowing. The company was growing too fast and had missteps with a couple new games. Also it opened a subsidiary in Japan that turned out to be a financial disaster. In May of 1974 Atari reported a $500,000 loss, and they laid off half the staff. Some were saying that the company looked like a one-trick pony. To help right the ship Atari and Kee merged at the end of 1974, and Joe Keenan became the president of Atari, while Bushnell kept the CEO title, Steve Bristow became head of Engineering, and Al Alcorn became head of R&D.

The company recovered the next year during the 1975 Christmas season, by releasing a home version of Pong exclusively through Sears retail stores. The home version was a commercial success. But soon it was competing with clones. Bushnell start relying heavily on Cyan Engineering.

<h4>Video Console System</h4>
By 1975, Ron Milner and Steve Mayer of Cyan Engineering had developed the first prototype of the Atari VCS. Joe Decuir was hired later that year to help with debugging the prototype and to help with building the first gate-level prototype. Decuir was a recent graduate from University of California, Berkeley. He had been interested in the 6502 microprocessor chip, which would become central to the VCS.

At this point in time Atari purchased Cyan Engineering and renamed it the Grass Valley Research Center.

The VCS was to be centered around two things, a MOS Technologies 6507 microprocessor, part of their 6502 series and an IC known as the Television Interface Adapter (TIA). The person instrumental in tying those two components together was Jay Miner. An accomplished microprocessor IC designer, he had co-founded Synertek in 1973, where he served as the company's primary chip designer. One of the company's earliest contracts were to create CMOS chips for the Bulova Watch Company. The company quickly became a second source manufacturer for chips designed by other firms such as Intel, Rockwell, and MOS Technology.

Programmable microprocessors would enable a console design significantly simpler and more powerful than any dedicated single-game unit. At the time microprocessors were expensive, $100â€“300 each, pricing most of them far outside the range of what the VCS market would pay.

Atari had opened negotiations to use Motorola's new 6800. But in September 1975, MOS Technology debuted the 6502 microprocessor for $25 at the Wescon trade show in San Francisco. Mayer and Milner attended and met with the leader of the team that created the chip, Chuck Peddle. Peddle proposed using the 6502 in a game console and offered to discuss it further at Cyan's facilities after the show.

Chuck Peddle was an electrical engineer, and while at Motorola recognized a market for a very low price microprocessor and began to champion such a design to complement the $300 Motorola 6800. His efforts were frustrated by Motorola management, and he was told to drop the project. He then left for MOS Technology, where he headed the design of the 6502 family of processors. Peddle was best known as the main designer of the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor. It was introduced in 1975, and was priced at 15% of the cost of an Intel 8080. It was the 6502 that was subsequently used the Apple II, Commodore PET and Commodore VIC-20.

The MOS 6502 used a new manufacturing process that produced a much higher yield rate than previous methods, which generally saw a low percentage of ICs that worked. The 6502 was so cheap that many people believed it was a scam when MOS first showed it at a 1975 trade show. Soon both Intel and Motorola were forced to dramatically lower their prices.

At about the same time the 6502 was being released, MOS's entire calculator IC market collapsed, and its prior existing products stopped shipping. Soon they were in serious financial trouble. Another company, Commodore Business Machines, had invested heavily in the calculator market and was also nearly wiped out by TI's entry into the market.

A fresh injection of capital saved Commodore, and allowed it to invest in company suppliers in order to help ensure their IC supply would not be upset in this fashion again. In late 1976, Commodore, publicly traded on the NYSE with a market capitalization around US$60 million, purchased MOS Technologies (whose market cap was around US$12 million) in an all-stock deal.

Back at Cyan, over the course of two days, MOS and Cyan engineers sketched out a 6502-based console design based on Meyer and Milner's specifications. Financial models showed that even at $25, the 6502 would be too expensive. Peddle then offered the 6507 microprocessor, a cost-reduced version of the 6502. Cyan and MOS negotiated the 6507 and its accompanying IO chip at $12 a pair.

MOS introduced Cyan to Microcomputer Associates, who had separately developed debugging software and hardware for MOS microprocessors, and had developed the JOLT Computer for testing the 6502. Jolt was the first 6502 single board computer. Jolt sold the board as both a kit for $249, or fully assembled and tested for $348.

Milner was able to demonstrate a proof-of-concept for a programmable console by implementing Tank, an arcade game by Atari's subsidiary Kee Games, on the JOLT.

Atari wanted a second source of the chip set. Peddle suggested Synertek whose co-founder, Bob Schreiner, was a friend of Peddle. In October 1975, Atari informed the market that it was moving forward with MOS.

Due to its manufacturing of the MOS Technology 65xx series of chips, Synertek was recommended as a partner to Atari, Inc. after it had been decided to use the MOS 6507 for the VCS console. One of Atari's engineers, Harold Lee, had worked with Miner at Standard MicroSystems and suggested him as the designer for a custom chip which would power Atari's new console. Through an arrangement with Synertek, Atari hired Miner in late 1975 to lead the chip design for the Atari VCS, primarily that of the display hardware, the TIA. The TIA sent graphics and audio to a television through via RF into a TV sets antenna connector.

By March 1976 with the help of Miner, the group in Grass Valley had a prototype that included included a TIA, a 6507 microprocessor, and a ROM cartridge slot and adapter. Decuir who was working with Miner on the design had apprenticed for Miner.

Atari also sent up Ted Hoth, who had been involved with the developing the Intel 4004, the very first microprocessor. Ted Hoth was a imposing guy at 6'4", who also had a background in nuclear metallurgy. Also on the team was hire Jim Heb, George Foster, John Sperry, and Herb Foster, who eventually started Viking Video, which made video disc recorders. Ironically back to Cyan's roots. Another young engineer working on the project was Chuck Meyer, today still a prominent player with the Grass Valley Company. He was doing doing development in 6502 assembly language for the 6507 the VCS was using.

The 6502 MOS Technologies salesman was aggressive and generous in handing out samples as the microprocessor business had become very competitive at that time. He seemed to have had a jewel case with "chemicals" he gave away along with the chips. That was when the 8-bit Intel 8080 was $1000 each.

While the base 6502 microprocessor was a more capable IC than the 6507 that was decided on, the 6507 was much cheaper. There were significant limitations in the 6507, which would run at 1.19 MHz in the VCS, which would be named the 2600, which while not lightning fast, it was fast enough. The 6507 was cheaper than the 6502 because its package included fewer memory address pinsâ€”13 instead of 16, reducing the already limited addressable memory to 4 KB. This was believed to be sufficient as Combat is itself only 2 KB. Later games circumvented this limitation with memory bank switching. This is where blocks of memory are switched between as needed.

As the VCS design became more refined, in 1977 Al Alcorn brought in Atari's game developers to provide input on features, as they had to modify their games to be ported to the VCS.

Never-the-less Atari was beat to market in November 1976 by The Fairchild Channel F, short for "Channel Fun." It was the first video game console to use ROM cartridges, instead of having games built-in, and the first console to use a microprocessor. It had a retail price of US$169.95. Equivalent to $772.92 in 2020.

Bushnell brought in Gene Landrum, a consultant who had consulted for Fairchild on its Channel F, to determine the consumer requirements for the console. Landrum suggested the following:
• A living room aesthetic, with a wood grain finish
• The cartridges must be "idiot proof, child proof and effective in resisting potential static [electricity] problems in a living room environment."
• Recommended it include four to five dedicated games in addition to the cartridges, which was ignored.
• The cartridge design was done by James Asher and Douglas Hardy. Hardy had been an engineer for Fairchild and helped in the initial design of the Channel F cartridges, but he quit to join Atari in 1976.

The interior of the cartridge that Asher and Hardy designed was sufficiently different to avoid patent conflicts, but the exterior components were directly influenced by the Channel F to help work around the static electricity concerns. Atari encountered production problems during its first batch, and its testing was complicated by the use of cartridges.

<h4>Warner</h4>
Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive. Atari was still recovering from its 1974 financial woes and needed additional capital to fully enter the home console market, though Bushnell was wary of being beholden to outside financial sources. Atari obtained smaller investments through 1975, but not at the scale it needed, and began considering a sale to a larger firm by early 1976. Looking for outside investors, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in October 1976 for an estimated $28â€“32 million. Atari revenue at that time was around $30 million/year.

Warner saw the potential for the growing video game industry to help offset declining profits from its film and music divisions. Negotiations took place during 1976, during which Atari had to clear itself of some liabilities. Those included settling a patent infringement lawsuit with Magnavox over Ralph H. Baer's patents that were the basis for the Magnavox Odyssey.

Ralph Henry Baer was a German-American inventor, game developer, and engineer. Baer's family fled Germany just before World War II, and Baer served the American war effort, gaining an interest in electronics. After several jobs in the electronics industry, he was working as an engineer at Sanders Associates (now BAE Systems) in Nashua, NH. There, around 1966, he conceived the idea of playing games on a television screen. With support of his employers, he worked through several prototypes until he arrived at a "Brown Box." That box would later become the blueprint for the first home video game console, licensed by Magnavox as the Magnavox Odyssey.

Warner provided an additional $120 million which allowed the project to be fast-tracked. The Atari VCS console was finally released in 1977. The unit was showcased on June 4, 1977 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show with plans for retail release in October. The announcement was purportedly delayed to wait out the terms of the Magnavox patent lawsuit settlement, which would have given Magnavox all technical information on any of Atari's products announced between June 1, 1976 and June 1, 1977. The introductory price of $199 (equivalent to $894 in 2019) included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles, and the Combat game cartridge.

Warner was a traditional, proper normal business. In Silicon Valley, Atari was not normal business. It was a very hit-driven technology business. It was an industry where you had to eat your own young because if you didn't, somebody else would. Warner management team did not understand this. Instead they ran Atari like a big, bureaucratic organization that supported it current products.

Atari created unique products and had played a big part in started a whole new industry. Sony's founder Akio Morita, once came to Silicon Valley to see Atari. He said they don't plan; they just build it.

<h5>An interesting aside during VCS development</h5>
Steve Wozniak wanted a Pong game badly enough that he designed and built his own version. He gave the board to Steve Jobs, who took it to Atari. Atari mistakenly thought that Jobs had designed the board and hired him as a technician. But Jobs only stayed at Atari for a few months and left for India in search of spiritual enlightenment. He returned back to the States and Atari in mid-75. The company assigned him to design a new game, which became Breakout. Bushnell and company, knew by then of Wozniakâ€™s design prowess, and Jobs friendship with him, and believed he would take the task to Wozniak. Jobs was considered, at the time, a low-level Atari technician with huge potential. Jobs and Wozniak had been working on the Apple 1 development for some time at that point.

Jobs told Wozniak that the design had to be done in only four days, when the time frame was actually a month. Jobs self-imposed deadline was that he was involved with an apple harvest up in Oregon and wanted to go soon. The other major part of the contract that Jobs had with Atari was that a bonus of $100 for every chip fewer than 80 in the design would be paid, in addition to a base of $700. Jobs told Wozniak only about the $700 base pay, which Jobs said he would split with Wozniak. Wozniak proceeded to produce a final design using only 45 chips.

Wozniak saw $350 out of his efforts. Jobs saw $4300. It is reported the Wozniak cried when he discovered the disparity years later. Wozniak worked nights for four days to finish the game as quickly as he could, while holding down his day job at HP.

The game was released in May of 1976 and was highly successful and was among the top five highest-grossing arcade video games of 1976 in both the United States and Japan and moving up to the top three in 77. In 1978 it was ported to an Atari VCS (Video Computer System) cartridge. While the arcade version was monochrome the VCS used color graphics. It was included with the console with the next generation VCS, the Atari 5200 console in 1982.

<h4>Bushnell's exit</h4>
In 1978, Atari sold only 550,000 of the 800,000 systems manufactured. This required further financial support from Warner to cover losses. After a couple of years Warner decided that Atari had to run like a normal business, so Warner installed their professional managers, who came out of traditional management where they're used to having products that don't have short life cycles.

Al Alcorn stated that "When companies take over another company, they often fail, because these fat, gray-haired men on the board don't understand culture, and they just see the business relationship. They try to merge two companies together and if the cultures don't work, it's never going to work. And this happens time and time again. It seems great on the spreadsheet or paper." Warner had bought Atari and treated it as a cash cow. There were no long-term plans.

In February 1978 Ray Kassar was hired as president of Atari Inc.'s consumer division by Warner Communications. He had previously been executive vice-president of Burlington Industries, the world's largest textile company at the time, and president of its Burlington House division. A member of the Board of Directors, Kassar had spent over thirty years at Burlington.

During the Kassar years, Atari Inc.'s sales grew from $75 million in 1977 to over $2.2 billion just three years later. Though Atari enjoyed some of its greatest success during this period, the stifling atmosphere and lack of royalties or recognition to the individual game designers angered employees, many of whom quit. During this period, nearly all members of the original Atari Inc. staff, including Al Alcorn, quit, or were fired. Rifts had begun to develop between the original Atari Inc. staff, most of whom had engineering backgrounds, and the new hires brought in by Warner, who, like Kassar, mostly had business backgrounds. Atari Inc. upper management also suffered severe turnover rates. Many blamed Ray Kassar's autocratic management style.

In December 1978 Nolan Bushnell was fired following an argument with Manny Gerard. Bushnell said that Warner claim they fired me, I say I quit. It was a mutual separation. Gerard was a member of the Office of the President for Warner during the Atari days from 1976, when they acquired Atari, to 1984 when it sold to the Atari. He was a key person in the decision for Warner to acquire Atari.

Bushnell had concerns on Kassar's plans and feared they would produced too many units to be sold, and at a board meeting with Warner near the end of the year, reiterated this position. Bushnell's concerns never materialized as a combination of Kassar's marketing and the popularity of game licensed from a Japanese company, Space Invaders drove Atari VCS sales. Both Warner Communications and Bushnell commonly recognized he was no longer a good leader for the company, removing him as CEO and Chairman in early 1979.

Warner did offer Bushnell the opportunity to stay as a director and creative consultant, but Bushnell refused. Before leaving, Bushnell negotiated the rights to Pizza Time Theater from Atari for $500,000. It had been created by Bushnell, originally as a place where kids could go and eat pizza and play video games, which would therefore function as a distribution channel for Atari games. Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theater also had animatronic animals that played music as entertainment. It was known that Bushnell had always wanted to work for Walt Disney but was continually turned down for employment when he was first starting out after graduation; Chuck E. Cheese was his homage to Disney and the technology developed there. In 1981 Bushnell turned over day-to-day food operations of Chuck E. Cheese's to a newly hired restaurant executive and focused on Catalyst Technologies.

Keenan replaced Bushnell but left a few months later, with Kassar being named as Atari's CEO by mid-1979

Atari sold more than 1 million consoles over the 1979 holiday season, but there was new competition from the Mattel Electronics Intellivision and Magnavox Odyssey, which also used swappable ROM cartridges.

At one point four game programmers wanted a small commission, but when they asked Kassar about that, David Crane recalls that Kassar responded, "You are no more important to that game than the guy on the assembly line who puts it together." So Crane and three others resigned from Atari and formed their own company: Activision, which became the first ever third party game developer. The new company formed by Crane, Whitehead, and Miller in 1979, started developing third-party VCS games using their knowledge of VCS design and programming tricks, and began releasing games in 1980.

In 1980, Atari attempted to block the sale of the Activision cartridges, accusing the four of intellectual property infringement. The two companies settled out of court, with Activision agreeing to pay Atari a licensing fee for their games. Kaboom! (1981) and Pitfall! (1982) are among the most successful with at least one and four million copies sold, respectively.

As soon as the 2600 started shipping, Atari started development on its replacement, and halfway into the development the home computer business exploded so that replacement became a full computer, the Atari 800. It sold from 1979 to 1992. It had a MOS technology 6502. At the height of its run between 1979 and 1985 the 800 sold 2 million units.

In 1980 the Commodore 64 debuts. At the time Guinness world records claims it was the highest selling single computer model of all time. At its height it was selling 2 million units per year. A number of months they were building 400,000 64s a month.

In addition to third-party game development, Atari also received the first major threat to its hardware dominance from "Colecovision." Coleco had a license from Nintendo to develop a version of the smash hit arcade game Donkey Kong (1981), which was bundled with every Colecovision console. Coleco sales then doubled again for the next two years; by 1982, 10 million consoles had been sold, while its best-selling game was Pac-Man at over 7.9 million copies sold by 1983. Coleco gained a 17% share of the hardware market in 1982 compared to Atari's 58%. With third parties competing for market share also increasingly competing for market share.

In 1982, the 2600 cost Atari only about $40 to make and was sold for an average of $125, equivalent to $340 in 2020. In 1982, Atari launched its second programmable console, the Atari 5200. The company spent $4.50 to $6 to manufacture each cartridge, plus $1 to $2 for advertising, wholesaling for $18.95, equivalent to $50 in 2020. Atari worked to maintain dominance in the market by acquiring licenses for popular arcade games and other properties to make games from.

<h4>Video Game Crash</h4>
Heading into the 1982 holiday shopping season, Atari had placed high sales expectations on "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," a game programmed in about six weeks. Atari produced an estimated four million cartridges, but the game was poorly reviewed, and only about 1.5 million units were sold.

Warner Communications reported weaker results than expected in December 1982 to its shareholders, having expected a 50% year-to-year growth but only obtaining 10â€“15% due to declining sales at Atari. Atari's major competition at the time was the Commodore 64. Coupled with the over-saturated home game market, Atari's weakened position led investors to start pulling funds out of video games, beginning a cascade of disastrous effects known as the video game crash of 1983.

Many of the third-party developers formed prior to 1983 were closed. In September 1983, Atari sent 14 truckloads of unsold Atari 2600 cartridges and other equipment to a landfill in the New Mexico desert, later labeled the "Atari video game burial." Long considered an urban legend that claimed the burial contained millions of unsold cartridges, the site was excavated in 2014, confirming reports from former Atari executives that only about 700,000 cartridges had actually been buried.

Atari reported a $536 million loss for 1983 as a whole. In July 1983, Kassar was fired due to continuing massive losses at Atari. In December 1982, Kassar had sold 5,000 shares of stock in Warner Communications only 23 minutes before a much lower than expected fourth quarter earnings report would cause Warner stock to drop nearly 40% in value in the following days. The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Kassar and then Atari Inc. vice-president Dennis Groth of trading stock with illegal insider knowledge. Kassar settled, returning his profits without acknowledging guilt or innocence.

Atari had invested heavily in games for the 2600, that became commercial failures and contributed to the video game crash of 1983 which ended the market relevance of the 2600. Some of the crash is attributed to saturation of the market for video games, standalone that is, and the rise of home computers.

Atari continued to lose money into 1984, with a $425 million loss reported in the second quarter. Coleco's success with Donkey Kong greatly hurt Atari that year. By mid-1984, third party software development for the 2600 had essentially stopped except by Atari and Activision. By 1984 games for the 2600 were using more than four times the ROM of the initially launch games.

<h4>Fire Sale</h4>
Warner, wary of supporting its failing Atari division, started looking for buyers in 1984. Warner sold most of Atari to Jack Tramiel, the founder of Commodore International, in July 1984 for about $240 million. Interestingly it was Tramiel who rescued MOS Technologies, preserving the microprocessor that his computers, and that Atari's VCS ran on. Warner retained Atari's arcade business and Ataritel, who we will look at shortly.

Tramiel was a proponent of personal computers, and de-prioritized further Atari console development following the sale. Tramiel's offer to Atari was to do a debt swap. He said it was worth more than Atari was. Taking advantage of Warner Communication's financial situation, the neighboring company of Time Inc. announced on March 4, 1989, that the two companies were to merge

Both Mattel and Coleco left the video game market by 1985. The North American video game market did not recover until about 1986, after Nintendo's 1985 launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America. Video game revenues went from 3.2 billion in 1983 and fell to around 100 million in 1985, a drop of almost 97%.

Tramiel' Atari released a redesigned model of the 5200 in 1986, supported by an ad campaign touting a price of "under 50 bucks," bt it wasn't what led the recovery of the industry, it was Nintendo. With a large library of cartridges and a low price point, the 5200 continued to sell into the late 1980s. Atari released the last batch of games in 1989â€“90. After more than 14 years on the market, the 5200 line was formally discontinued on January 1, 1992, along with the Atari 8-bit family of home computers.

<h4>AtariTel</h4>
While not an Atari initiated project, in 1981 the Cyan group started on a "skunk works" type project. The genesis of this were a number of court cases starting in the 50s that forced AT&T to relinquish its iron grip on its phone network.

In 1956 the court had ruled that Hush-A-Phone Corporation couls sell a small, cup-like device which mounted on the speaking party's handset microphone, reducing the risk of conversations being overheard and increasing sound fidelity for the listening party. AT&T claimed that was not allowed. The court ruled differently stating that devices could mechanically connect to a phone-company-owned telephone without the permission of AT&T.

With the rise of corporate computer use in the 60s and into the 70s many customers and computer manufacturers wanted to be able to connect peripherals to main frames over phone lines. The FCC looked into a lawsuit that Carterfone had filed against AT&T. In 1968, the Federal Communications Commission extended this privilege by allowing the Carterfone and other devices to also be mechanically connected to the AT&T network, as long as they did not cause harm to the system. This device was acoustically, but not electrically, connected to the a telephone. It was electrically connected to a base station of the mobile radio system, and got its power from the base station. When someone on a two-way radio wished to speak to someone on a "landline" the radio station operator at the base would dial the requested telephone number. When the call was connected the handset of the operator's telephone was placed on a cradle built into the Carterfone device. A voice-operated switch in the Carterfone automatically switched on the radio transmitter when the telephone caller was speaking, and the radio was returned to a receiving condition when the person on the phone was silent.
Then in 1974 the Justice filed anti-trust against AT&T. The suit came to trial in 1981 trial. AT&T settled. On January 1st, 1984 the regional phone companies under AT&T control, the "baby bells," were divested and split into seven smaller regional bells, while AT&T kept the long lines.

When it became obvious that phone deregulation was going to happen the Cyan folks went to work. Larry Emmons always wanted to do a picture phone. Development commenced, while it would be black & white, and it only periodically sent video snapshots, it would still be groundbreaking. The project, known as Falcon, was headed up by Steve Bristow. David Stokes designed video refresh hardware. Emmons designed the echo canceling electronics, as he was purely an analog guy. Chuck Meyer did the modem.

Soon Atari did embrace the project. In a 1981 Atari business plan for AtariTel, as the concept became known as,it was observed that there were 166 million telephones in the US in 1980, compared to approximately 270 million in all other countries of the world combined. In 1980 Americans use the telephone to place an average of 475 million local and over 40 million long distance calls every day.

The project was announced to the public in 1983 at the Consumer Electronics Show after nearly 2 years of working in secret. Atari had applied for trademark protection of AtariTel right before the show. The press release stated that Atari engineers had created a whole new line of consumer-electronics, which incorporates new technology and features not available in other residential telecommunications products. The release did foresee the possibility of "dramatically capable home network for voice communications, communications management, appliance control, security and environmental control." While in this age of zoom calls it hard to remember that then, this was to use plain old dial-up voice lines, which usually did not have the fidelity of AM radio. Cell phone communications was in its infancy then, and it was only analog. The digital cell network was still over a decade out.

Atari commissioned two of the world's leading industrial designers, Porsche Design and Morrison Cousins associates to develop the product's exterior design.

<h5>The End</h5>
At its peak Cyan engineering had 30 employees. Cyan's decent started in 1983-84 when stand-alone gaming crashes and burns. Throughout the 80s Atari really had no video game success. Plus its computers were proprietary and slowly lost out to Wintel. Atari's sale to Tramiel did not include AtariTel as he did not want it. For a short while AtariTel was still intended to more forward as a separate division. Manny Gerard then decided to try and to sell AtariTel to Mitsubishi. AtariTel during that time went to Warner and tried to buy AtariTel. Warner said no to the offer as it was believed that a better Mitsubishi deal was close. In a case where one hand did not know what the other was doing, right before the deal happened, someone in HR showed up and shut the Cyan down. But Larry Emmons managed to hold enough of the operation together and Mitsubishi goes through with the deal. A number of Cyan employees went with the sale to Mitsubishi.

Mitsubishi re-branded AteriTel and sold the picture phones for a few years, at which point technology, and plain old marketing forces made the picture phone platform obsolete.

After the sale of the consumer games to Tramiel, with Warner keeping the arcade division, both pieces from there out continued to be bought and sold, merged, re-organized, etc. Much like the story of Grass Valley Company. At the beginning of 1999 the company Atari merged with Hasbo. Atari's intellectual property was sold to Hasbro interactive for only 5 million in cash. The name had already been sold to another company for home use.

Atari might have been the fastest zero to making millions to back to zero maybe ever.

<h6>Applied Design Labs</h6>
The surviving group up in Grass Valley re-constituted Cyan Engineering as Applied Design Labs (ADL). Cyan had carried out some robotics research and development work on behalf of Atari, including the Kermit mobile robot, originally intended as a stand-alone product intended to bring a beer. The company also programmed the original animatronics for Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theater pizza chain in 1977.

After Atari, as ADL is continued research work on small portable "briefcase sized" computers along with pointing devices (mice) & touch screens, before these devices became commonplace. They also continued to work with Nolan Bushnell who wanted an innovative stuffed animal, a "recording teddy bear" that could play back brief sentences spoken to it. He had just started a toy company, Axlon, and had lots of ideas but no electronics design department.

Bushnell gave ADL two tough requirements for the bear's voice:
• The voice box has to cost less than $2.50 to build
• And it had to be ready for the International Toy Fair, only two months out!"

They delivered.

ADL also hooked up with Ultra-marathon runner Jim Walker, who was frustrated with the absence of a reliable way to measure distance so he could get off the track for his workouts.
ADL combined his expertise in the field with Ron Milner's ultrasonic distance measuring technique and ADL's electronics and design experience to build an advanced pedometer. It became known as the Monitor. The concept was accepted by Nike.

ADL also developed HOT LIXX Guitar, which was voted a top boys' toy. ADL idea: combine interesting variations of music in an instrument such as a guitar for listening and performing pleasure by people without musical training.
