<h1>Chapter 12 - Games of Thrones</h1>
For a long time, even after the Doc Hare rein, the Group was a leader in the television industry, and the movers and shakers of the industry would trek to Grass Valley to witness what the company had to offer, and to seek solutions for technical issues they faced. At some point that spirit of being out front and leading the way gave way to a more cautious and buttoned down way of doing business. Many would argue that that was Tek's doing, and in many ways it was. But some of it might be that the company out grew the small town mindset that the towns of Grass Valley and Nevada City had. It's roots were definitely in the area, and at one time the setting in the foothills of the Sierra was a recruiting tool in itself. But times and attitudes inevitably change, and towards the end of the book we'll look why that is.

We will now look at the leadership that ushered the group from a proud prize of Tektronix, to being cast off after 26 years in Tek's camp.

<h2>Dan Wright</h2>	
In April of 1983 Tom Long left Tektronix to go east to work for Analogic, in Peabody, Massachusetts, where he was the Executive VP in charge of Operational Management. Long, was the President of the Group for nine years. At the time GVG's Management Council said, "Tom's expertise and leadership during his 23 years at Tek have been a great asset to our company. We will miss him and wish him well in his new venture."

Long was not a good fit in his new position and locale, he was back the next year as the VP and GM of Tektronix's Design Automation Group, and the President of the Tektronix Development Company, where he ran Tektronix Labs, in Beaverton.

While he was only gone from the company for a year, it left an opening for Dave Friedley to move up. Tektronix EVP Bill Walker said, "Dave's experience with both the Communications Division and the Grass Valley Group make him well suited for his new responsibilities. The Communications Division and the Grass Valley Group have, over the years, maintained their leadership positions in their respective markets. Dave's expertise and leadership will greatly contribute to the Division's continuing record of success." Friedley, his wife Carol, and their three children relocated to Oregon.

Now for the first, and only time a leader from the Group started their rise up the top of the parents corporate ladder, instead of being "sent down" to oversee the Group. This demonstrated that at the time Tek was happy with Grass Valley's contribution to the larger organization. 
************************************Is this statement correct?******************************************************

Before Dave left for Tektronix he made Dan Wright Executive VP. Wright promoted David Mayfield to Modular Product Division's GM as his replacement. 
**********************************************************************
A bit fuzzy on the trajectory of Mayfield: Was he MPD marketing, then its GM, later moved to PVD GM, then Group GM? 
**********************************************************************
Wright had been a manufacturing engineer, who was instrumental in getting the 300 into production. Under Wright the commitment to "divisionalization" continued. Some thought that this devotion to the concept created silos and internal competition that was destructive to the morale of the employees. It was also claimed that he tried a number of McKinsey and Tom Peters type strategies. One such strategy was management by walking around (MBWA). That one seemed to work as Wright was known for actually visiting, and even performing tasks that "on the ground" employees did.

Most thought Wright was a nice guy, but even practicing MBWA he never quite understood how people worked. He was not a pure technologist, so at times he did not understand the technical ramifications put before him.

Dan was a manufacturing engineer in Tek's spectrum analyzer group when, in 1979, Dave Friedley brought him to GVG. GVG was having difficulty (what difficulties?) moving the 300 production switcher from engineering to manufacturing, and Friedley hoped that Dan would be able to help. Where the Group needed help was for the first time, with the 300 production switcher, the company was striving to produce a high end product that even with a boatload of options, could be treated more as a "massed produced" product instead of a continuous series of "one-of" job-shop products. Wright had that experience through Tek, while no one in the Group did at the time. He was successful in doing so, so when Friedley decided to "divisionalize" GVG, he chose Dan as the general manager of GVG's first division, Modular Products. Wright continued Friedley's efforts to "Tekify" GVG. 

In fairness to the whole "divisionalize" concept, it could be argued that the fact that the Bitney Springs site couldn't be grown much more, and as we saw that nature and local government was making the site untenable. That left a couple of choices. To expand off site, and to start they could have just moved the Modular Products manufacturing into leased space and have it continue reporting through Jerry Sakai up through the Bitney Springs hierarchy. But with the decision to buy the Providence Mine site, the future was going to be a more geographically dispersed company. At the time no one had an inkling that eventually that dispersal would be world wide as we will see.

Dan Wright grew up in Monticello, Indiana and graduated from Purdue University in 1968 with a degree in engineering technology. He went to work for Collins Radio in Cedar Rapids, Iowa before joining the Air Force during the Vietnam war. Five years later he left as a captain with extensive experience conducting evaluation missions for the Aerospace Defense Command.

He joined Tektronix in I974 as a design engineer. Five years later he was a manufacturing manager when he signed on at GVG. In 1980 he became the manager of MPG.

It was said that Fridley was Dan Wright's rabbi. That is without any religious or spiritual significance, "a primary sponsor or protector", also means a "mentor or teacher". Both were true in Friedley's case.

Extremely successful 100 small production switcher  

n 1984 the 1680 production switcher, the panel laid out to be familiar to 1600 users, but with many 300 features, and the enormously successful 100 small production switcher were introduced. That year Wright oversaw the Groups acquisition of Dubner Computer Systems. This allowed Dan to check the box "did an acquisition." The fact that the folks at ABC, still the Groups biggest customer, liked Dubner products made it an easy sell to Tektronix and the Group's customer base. Julius Barnathan ABC's head of engineering was instrumental in putting the deal together because they had a pretty significant investment in Dubner equipment and weren't confident that Harvey Dubner, founder and CEO, could really run a company successfully. In the end, the Dubner acquisition was not very successful because Wright and those that followed had no clue how to manage Harvey. The brand was retired by the Group in 1991.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/1984NAB%20hare%20group%20shot.jpg
In 1984, the 25th anniversary of the Group, somebody concocted a story  to lure Doc Hare to come to NAB and Bill Rorden flew him there in his plane. The event was honoring Doc and ABC was the presenter. In the first shot the players left to right are Dave Friedley, Helen McMillen, Bob Cobler, Julius Barnathan (VP engineering at ABC), Jerry Sakai, Doc Hare, Birney Dayton, Hazel Hare, Vern Pointer (Executive VP ABC), Max Berry (One of ABCâ€™s top engineers), Dan Wright, Bill Rorden, and Bob Johnson.
***************************What was the story the concocted?)****************************************************

1985 brought a few new milestones. A new audio/video router, the Horizon, and a new line of modular products, the 8500 was introduced.

Wright also did another acquisition, Interactive Systems Company (ISC). Dave Bargen started his company after several large post companies on the U.S West coast wanted to upgrade or modify their existing online CMX suites but weren't prepared to wait for Bill Orr's company to release an updated CMX editor. CMX was a joint venture started by CBS (the C) and Memorex (the MX) to build what became the first sophisticated video tape editing system. These systems were not small (as we have seen), nor were they cheap, complete systems would cost between $60,000 to $200,000. They consisted of a DEC PDP-11 mini-computer, and what were called Intelligent Interfaces (or I-Squares), one was needed for each device that was to be controlled. In the 80s memory was expensive, microprocessors were a number of generations from being capable enough, so instead of desktop editing as done today, you needed a room full of equipment. So those post houses commissioned Bargen to create new software that added extra features to the existing CMX hardware.

The software came to be known as 409, as it claimed it cleaned up the "bugs" in CMX's software.

Bargen knew that for ISC to be a long term success he would need to include the ability to control video and audio peripherals. His own version of the I-Square. Bargen's longtime friend, Vidtronics chief engineer Jack Callaway was an expert on VTR machine control. Callaway and Bill Gordon reverse-engineered the CMX interface protocol, and built a simpler, and smaller interface. Where the CMX I-Square was about 12 inches high, Callaway's was less than two inches tall.

The units became known as Callaway boxes and allowed ISC to offer editors an alternative. Complete ISC systems sold for $30,000 to $50,000. This system spelled the start of the end for CMX. While CMX could of built a smaller I-Square at the time, internally the justification for a larger box was how could they charge over $10K per I-Square it the unit was much smaller.

The other nail in the coffin was the introduction of the RS-422 remote control standard. As we saw earlier RS-422 was a godsend to NVISION, in a search to find relevance, started making RS-422 routers. But it undermined the business model that CMX had thrived on up until that time. Up until then each I-Squared required different hardware configurations based on the particular device being controlled. Thus an I-Squared configured for one device could not be used with a different device. Although first introduced in 1975, RS-422 started being incorporated into devices in mass by the mid-80s. RS-422 made it easier to connect I-Squares to different devices, usually allowing a facility to require fewer of them. Once CMX, and others went to RS-422 control, the hardware was always the same, all that changed was the firmware. The Group was now squarely, in the editing market.

That year also saw the infamous meeting with Sony at NAB over the Group productizing and offering an analog HDTV version of the 300. Wright wanted to see a market first. Up until that time the Group usually responded to customer requests, very often from ABC, before proceeding with a product. Sony was the opposite, as they were in more of the television food chain, both consumer and broadcast, than the Group was. Color TV set sales were flattening as color set penetration was nearing saturation, and Sony was looking for a reason for people to buy more sets. Just as RCA had commanded NBC to produce all shows in color at the start of the 60s to sell color TV sets, Sony was trying to create a new TV market it could sell into. They were taking the long view. The Group could not or would not do the same. Some of the blinders for not seeing a coming new technology, that is higher video quality, in the form of HD, could be laid at the feet of ABC. ABC as mentioned viewed Grass Valley as their equipment development arm. There was always a need validation if ABC wanted something new. ABC had no interest in HD at that time. Plus the Group's limited resources were tied up with the their first Digital Video Effects engine, the Kaleidoscope; and it was an abitious project as we have already seen.

At the end of 1987 construction at the Providence Mine site finally commenced on the first three buildings. When it was originally bought at the end of 1982, the intention was to use it for additional growth, which many thought would keep happening in the area. The thinking at the time was that the company's growth rate would continue at 15%. The Bitney Springs site was rapidly being built out to capacity, and the environmental cost were rising at that site. The new site was planned to hold 2000 employees in a dozen buildings. Being only 500 feet from a main water line, and adjacent to Nevada City's wastewater plant with easy freeway access, and secluded at the same time, it seemed like a good move. As we have seen there was another reason for the new campus. Bitney Springs was becoming untenable.

In 1987 Friedley made it to the top of Tektronix. He replaced long time president Earl Wantland. The company wanted a person that would freshly address the issues that were building at the company. While Friedley had started at Tek, and was sent down to the Group as its first Tek minted manager, the company in the 80s had done well. The company was "on top of its game." He replaced Tom Long in 82 when he left as the head of the Television Division at Tek. From his Tek vantage point, as head of the TV division he and Wright sheparded the Grass Valley operation with steady growth. The Production Systems Division (high end switchers and DVEs) and the Professional Video Division, (low end switchers and DVEs), both saw a dramatic growth spike during that time. But all of the company's divisions saw decent growth during the period. Those were the heady days of the Group. When it was time to replace Wantland, the division manager who oversaw Grass Valley, one-half of the revenues of the Television Division, seemed like the natural choice.

At the same time Friedley replaced Wantland, he could not have ascended to head Tektronix at a worst time. Tektronix had acquired CAE Systems Inc and introduced its first Computer Aided Design (CAD) workstation. It was short-lived. Four months later, the company announced that instead of producing Workstations, it would develop software for other manufacturers. That too faltered. So one of the first things Friedley did was to sell its CAE operations at a fire sale for $5 million to Mentor Graphics. Estimates of Tek's losses from this ranged from $150 million to $225 million.

When Friedley became Tek's CEO he replaced three of the four top Tek Vice Presidents. Wright ran the Group up to 1988 when Friedley used Wright as his replacement again, and Wright assumed the VP title for Tek's Communications Division, which was newly formed at the time out of the TV Products Group. It was comprised of the Group, Tek's Video Products, Network Analyzers, and Tek's Hybrid Circuits. Wright tried to do this job from Grass Valley and not move back to Oregon.

Besides Wright, Friedley made Larry Kaplan, who was the head of the TV Products Group, the VP of the newly formed Information Display Group. This group had workstations, terminals, printers, and the printed circuit board operations He will become more predominate shortly.

Despite annual revenues that had almost doubled in ten years to $1.4 billion in 1985, they had stayed there since. Tektronix reported its first-ever loss of $16.7 million for fiscal 1988. Friedley later told Forbes, "The first thing we did was stop the bleeding." In addition to getting out of unprofitable businesses, Friedley eliminated 2,500 jobs at Tektronix over the next two years. Business Week reported that Friedley "cut through bureaucracy like a logger through the nearby Oregon timber." But it was not enough. Tektronix returned to modest profitability in 1989, due to stringent cost-cutting and a new line of color printers. But its financial troubles were far from over.

1988 was a bad year for the Group also. As we saw in chapter 9, on September 11th the 49er fire started. It burned through part of the Bitney Springs site. Luckily it only took a couple of ancillary buildings. But Tek suddenly realized that they had a company that was doing $129 million of income a year in a place that could literally burn up during the long dry season that occurs in California every summer, and into the fall.

A bright spot was the Kadenza, the result of turning the Kscope DVE into a full standalone switcher, which started shipping.

During the 80s the Group, from a growth standpoint had a very good run. At the start of the 80s the Group was below $50 million a year in revenue, by 89 it had grown steadily to $158 million. At the start of the 90s that growth hit a wall.

<h2>Dave Mayfield</h2>
Dan Wright appointed Dave Mayfield as his successor as Executive Vice President and GM of the Group. Mayfield had been the division manager of another division formed a couple of years prior, the Professional Video Division (PVD) which was the small switcher division at the time. Many were surprised at this appointment, because Mayfield had no experience at all as a manager of multi-functional groups. Some said his only apparent "qualification" for the top job at GVG was that he was a close personal friend of Dan Wright's and a member of the same evangelical church as Wright. 
************Again a bit fuzzy on the trajectory of Mayfield: MPD marketing, than PVD GM, then Group GM?)*****************

Randy Hood, who was the division's marketing manager, took over MPG. Correct?

During Mayfield's time the company launched a new switcher line, the Diamond, which was an analog switcher, and a new DVE, the DPM-100.

The company was still considered novel and eccentric, but in interesting ways. Located about 150 miles northeast of San Francisco, Grass Valley Group had its own airplane to fly customers in and out of the remote, wooded company headquarters. Some of the Group's lure as an remote outpost was at that time considered "a plus and minus when it came to recruitment," according Mayfield.

An article by the LA Times at the time mentioned the following: "Designed to appeal to "free-thinking" employees (one company executive ventured to call them "mavericks"), flex-time schedules are available for most of the nearly 1,000 workers who work in Grass Valley. Assemblers work in self-managed "cells" rather than production lines, rotating jobs and setting their own production goals. As an added incentive, a profit-sharing program was introduced in 1976."

The article continued: "A fitness trail winds its way through the 330-acres of campus-like grounds and fleets of bright turquoise company bicycles are parked outside each of nine buildings to carry employees and visitors about the grounds. And if the habits of the free-thinkers at Grass Valley Group sometimes border on the eccentric, so much the better. One department is so adamantly unorthodox that if an outside salesman makes a call wearing a necktie, he'll more than likely lose it--to a pair of scissors, according to Bob Johnson."

<h3>Friedley Out</h3>

David Friedley

The start of the 20th century's last decade was going to be a tumultuous time for both the Group and its mother ship. In early 1990, the company was again posting losses, Tektronix stock had fallen in value from $31 a share in 1987 to a 14-year low of $12.75 a share. In 1990 Tek posted a loss of $25 million, and sales were down 3%. Tek's main competitor in the test equipment realm was HP. In 1980 Tek was 1/2 the size of HP, by 1990 Tek is only 1/8th the size. A financial analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc., told Business Week that meetings with Tektronix "were like watching the grass grow." The anticipated shake-up came in March of 1990, with the company headed toward a $92.5 million loss (largely due to restructuring) for the fiscal year. Robert Lundeen, a former Dow Chemical Co. executive and Tektronix's chairman of the board, and William Walker, another board member, ousted Friedley and took over operational control of the company. Even though 62% of Tek's products had been introduced since 1986, they told Friedley that the turn-around just wasn't happening fast enough.

Many signs that the company was moving in the right direction were seen in the printing division, which had grown rapidly to $90 million in sales. New graphic terminals which had previously take three years from conception to production were taking only nine months instead of three years. A speedup in the design process was one of Friedley's goals. Another thing that was facing Tek, was systemic to the economy, a business slowdown was happening and Tek's largest customers, Defense, computers, and semiconductor companies were looking to cut costs.

Not all was positive. Tek's latest workstations were having software problems, and problems with Tek's semiconductor fab lines were delaying the shipment of test equipment. On the workstation front the company only had 3% of the market and its prospects for securing much more were bleak. Friedley also found that many in the company's engineering staff didn't focus near enough on the end customers needs. He was quoted as saying "I'm sure some of our whiz-bang people wouldn't know a customer if they saw one." The problem was not that the company was not investing in the future, it spent $190 million on research and development in 1989. The problem was many felt that the company wasn't getting a decent 'bang for the buck' from the money spent.

Some, including their main competitor's CEO, HP's Dean O. Morton said that they lacked a clear strategic vision and he said "They've had a difficult time figuring out what they want to be." Ironically HP confronted a similar problem a decade later when they spun off all the legacy product lines into Agilent Technologies. and kept only printers and computers. In 1990 Tek had a similar product mix. Printers, which were ascendant, test equipment and semiconductors, experiencing mixed results, and the increasingly burdensome television product lines. The company's major investors had become inpatient. At that time a couple major investors started saying that they thought the company was worth more split up than whole.

Citing the need to reverse the financial losses, Lundeen told Portland's Business Journal, "I don't think management realized how urgent it was that we get there quickly." Lundeen told Forbes, "I'd like the new Tektronix style to be more cosmopolitan," and he complained, "We're still doing things the Beaverton way." Lundeen initiated another 1,300 layoffs. In a blow to it's corporate image, Tektronix also transferred more than 1,200 workers from Vancouver, Washington, to Oregon, leaving vacant a 488,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Jack Murdock Park, an industrial center named for the company's co-founder. For years, Tektronix had been the largest employer in Oregon, with a high of more than 24,000 employees in 1981. But by the end of 1991, the company had a work force was less than half that.

<h3>Wright Gone</h3>
Birney Dayton said that Mayfield's promotion was the last straw that caused him to leave and start NVISION. With Mayfield the company' status quo, which was already fraying, seemed intact. Before Dayton left, Tektronix had bought a company down in the bay area called LP communications that made a T1 tester. Birney and a few others, along with the LP heads convinced Wright to combine those operations, along with Wavelink into one standalone entrepreneurial operation to make it worthwhile to operation to develop and market. Wright became convinced finally to not only spin this group off but that all of Tektronix should be split off in this way.

Wright pitched the Wavelink spinoff to Fridley, who didn't take kindly to Dan's proposal. The idea was that the parts were worth more than the whole. Friedley thought that would drive the company into max short term profit to get the max return on selling the company in parts.

Wright had pondered at times if it would be better if Grass Valley and Tek divorced. It was reported that had others had started advocating for the leveraged buyback of Grass Valley from Tek. Rumors flew that Sony was approached about buying GV. Most of the Tek board was having none of it at the time, even though, as mentioned some were already pushing that exact line of thinking.
Also from chapter 9: was a Wavelink spioff ever pitched. did Wright ever propose any of this?

When Friedley was let go, the lieutenant he had promoted, Wright, was unceremoniously informed by phone, that he was out of the company also. Why? The company also for the first time, started looking for the next CEO outside of the company.

<h3>Larry Kaplan &#45; Tek VP and GV GM</h3>
https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/kaplan.jpg
Larry Kaplan

Calamity was not only happening at the mothership; it was happening locally also. On Friday, November 16, 1990, Dave Mayfield, CFO Don McCauley, PSD GM Randy Hood, and PSD Engineer Dick Jackson, resigned from GVG "to pursue other interests outside of the Grass Valley Group." They tendered their resignations via letters FedEx'ed to Larry Kaplan, who had replaced Wright as VP of the Communications Division. As it would later become apparent, all but Mayfield left to start Immix, which produced a desktop editing system called VideoCube which would compete with the Group in that arena. Carlton Communications financed the new venture. Carlton also owned video equipment vendors Abekas and Quantel. Both competed against the Group in DVEs, and Quantel also competed in routers. Mayfield was not part of the Immix group, but joined Abekas as V.P. of Operations. Mayfield would eventually end up at BTS in Salt Lake City. We will see how BTS fits into the Group saga later. Randy Hood ended up as the head of the new company. To lose that talent, along with one of the Groups top digital designers, in short supply at the time, Dick Jackson, came as a blow to the Group, and Tek. In the wake of those resignations, Tek dispatched Larry Kaplan to Grass Valley to try to keep the troops under control.

Kaplan joined Tek in 1974 as a video sales engineer. He received a BSEE from the University of Wisconsin, and later a MBA from Rutgers. He went to work for ABC before joining Tek. In 79 he became a product marketing manager in the TV Business unit, and rose to the Marketing manager in the group. He then became the business development manager for the Communications Division in 1982. In 83, at the age of 32, he rose to head the Information Display Group.

Kaplan was put in charge of the Communications Division, and also assumed the presidency of Grass Valley. In a memo to "all employees" after Mayfield and company had left, Kaplan wrote, "As president of GVG, I have assumed day-to-day operational responsibilities. The key management team is intact and expects to function with your full support." In the weeks and months that followed, Kaplan held periodic managers meetings to address any issues that arose, and to provide updates on the search for a new person to lead the company.

One who worked with him at Tektronix said he had a realistic view of himself. Before this calmity he had been the operating head of the Information Display Group, which included the Workstation, Terminal & Printer divisions. He knew he was over his head when he was in charge of Tektronix workstations. When he was charged with GVG oversight, he knew that he faced a difficult task.

Larry Kaplan came down once a week to let people know the GV wasn't going away, and to report on progress for finding a new president. One thing he did in early 91 was to partially undo the Group's "divisionization." He merged the Professional Video Divisions into the Production Systems Division, which he and Bob Cobler ran until Kaplan found a new Grass Valley GM, and the Modular Products Division and Switching Products Division into a new group called the Distribution Systems Division, which was managed by Craig Soderquist. The company still had separate groups for the Wavelink product line, part of the Telecomm Systems Division, and the Dubner Computer Systems group.

Another thing he did was to sack Jerry Sakai as they weren't seeing eye-to-eye on the company's re-organization. Of the original management group that left only Cobler.

Eventually he found a guy he had worked with for a long time, Bob Wilson. At one time Ampex was Tektronix's largest customer for monitors and scopes, as every VTR shipped with one of each. Wilson had run Ampex's VTR group.

<h2>Bob Wilson</h2>
https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/wilson.jpg
https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/vr1200.jpg
Video monitor and waveform monitor highlighted

Wilson came on board in 1991 as the President and CEO of The Grass Valley Group, Inc.. Almost immediately it was apparent that he was too buttoned down for the area. His background was financial, not engineering. Also, he never committed to being a part of the local community. His career started at Ampex, the inventor of video tape machines, and a general competitor to the Group in the television production equipment arena.

Ampex was located on the San Francisco peninsula. At Ampex he held various senior management positions, including Vice President and General Manager, Marketing, Sales and Service; Vice President and General Manager, Magnetic Tape Division; Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Assistant General Manager, Audio/Video Systems Division. He had a brief stint at another company as the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director of the Wickes Companies, Inc. before coming to the Group.

In early 1991, at one of his regular meetings with Group managers, Larry Kaplan announced that he was about to close a deal with former the Ampex executive, to become the new head of GVG. Larry spoke glowingly about Wilson, and indicated that he would be joining GVG shortly, before the 1991 NAB show. After Wilson was onboard, at a pre-NAB press event that Jay Kuca had put together in New York, Wilson was given a detailed briefing document that outlined what the company would be introducing at that years NAB. Wilson immediately went "off script," as he was prone to do, and announced that he was "going to put GVG in the video recording business." He made that announcement based on something he had heard about an ill-fated project to develop an uncompressed Digital Disk Recorder, code named "Merlin." At the time, engineering had not even produced a working prototype, and as Kuca recalls, they never managed to get the product working properly. That was the beginning of a long and stormy relationship he had with Wilson. At one point Wilson tried to get Kuca fired, but he had built some very strong alliances with a number of senior GVG people, and Wilson did not prevail.

Another notable time that Wilson went off script was at a Tek conference at Salishan lodge on the Oregon coast. Dan Castles, who was reporting to Kaplan at the time, was told by Meyer, the then Tek President (he'll be introduced shortly) that Kaplan's group had an hour for their part of the presentation. Kaplan, Castles, and one other went first, and Wilson last. Each had been allotted 15 minutes for their presentations. Wilson went 50. Kaplan got reamed for it. This did not help Kaplan's standing with Meyer. While Kaplan gave Wilson the proper feedback, Wilson could care less. He was known as a big talker.

Part of the problem was that Wilson never managed to build his own alliances within the company. Wilson sailed and spent weekends with friends in the Bay area. Everyone got it that Grass Valley was not home, and thus it never endeared him to the locals.

Wilson ran the show during dark days for the Group in the early 90s. One of those challenges was trying to consolidate the company at the Providence Mines site in Nevada City, and vacate Bitney Springs and the airport sites. The plan originally was to move the 40% of the area employees out of those two sites and to the Providence site. At the time there were three buildings at the Providence site, with a fourth one in the planning stage. With the financial situation facing the Group at the time that building was put on hold, and ended up never being built.

On the engineering and product front the Group had another problem. Other than the crew working on Kaleidosope, the Group didn't have many engineers who had a clue about high speed digital technology because the whole background of the company to that point was analog. There may even have been some outside influence in that GV had designed new product around the needs of ABC for a couple of decades and Julius Barnathan, ABC's Engineering VP, was firmly opposed to the digital TV transition, which may have left GV without their historical guidance.

About that time Wilson made a big bet on fiber, with a project called Excalibur, for Williams Communications. They wanted to put fiber in their oil lines. The project failed and the Group lost over a million dollars.

He also pushed for the Group to get into the virtual studio set market. Virtual studio sets are chroma key technology on steroids. In a virtual studio, say a news set, the only thing real is essentially the people on the set, and what they are sitting on. Everything else is usually a sea of green. The problem was that the technology was not quite there in the early 90s, and the Group didn't offer enough of the food chain, namely cameras, not yet anyway. It went nowhere.

In 1991 and 92 a recession hit, and the Groups sales dropped. At the time the Kscope DVE was being replaced by a newer version, called Krystal. Routers were headed up by the 7000, they had glue products, the editor was Sabre, what had evolved out of the ISC editor. The 3000 switcher was shipping, and the 4000 component digital switcher was getting ready to launch. The problem with all these new products is they couldn't defend and push them all out the door very well. The Group was shipping very shaky version 1.0 products. In one year GV went from a $20 million profit to losing money.

Amidst all this activity Wilson decided not to increase engineering pools but took on more new products none-the-less. It became hard to defend so wide a territory from competitors. At the time the Group had two ascending adversaries, Sony, and Ross Video. While not rising, Ampex was in the game also. There was also a number of players in Europe. Ironically, eventually all those European players eventually became part of the Grass Valley story.

We looked at Sony already. Ross was started by John Ross, a former engineer with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Iroquois, Ont., in 1974 to make production switchers. Jim Leitch, founder of Leitch Video, another fairly prominent video company that was eventually acquired by Harris, initially suggested that Ross start the company. In 1978 Ross launched its second generation switcher. By 1983 they had their own version of Emem, and two years later a third generation switcher. By the 90s they had branched out into a line of modular products. In fact Leitch video was also a capable player in modular products as well. The Group had lots of competition. Tektronix took notice.

In the summer of 92 the Soros Group stated buying up shares of Tek stock, and as we will see, they greatly affected Tek's direction and approach. There were rumors that Soros wanted to break Tek up and sell it off piecemeal. As we saw, an idea that had occurred to others. All parts of the company, including the Grass Valley Group, were under increased scrutiny.

Dan Castles, who we will look at shortly, was sent down to try to help Wilson right the ship. Castles eventually concluded that Wilson was not a good fit for the task at hand. Wilson returned to bay area employers. At one point he was President of Pinnacle Systems, another television equipment vendor, that for a while had a presence in Grass Valley.

With all he was facing in his position, he never set up a permanent household in the local area. Commuting between the bay area and the Grass Valley area, and staying on site three or four days a week. It was said that he spent a lot of his free time on a boat in the bay. He was forced out in the beginning of 1994.
