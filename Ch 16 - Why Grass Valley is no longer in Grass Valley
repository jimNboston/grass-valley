Chapter 16 - Why Grass Valley is no longer in Grass Valley
<h2>In name only</h2>
Today the company with the same name as the town it started in is no longer headquartered in its namesake. At one time the Grass Valley Company employed over 1200 people in the area; and it was the largest employer in Nevada County, where the towns of Grass Valley, and its adjacent neighbor, Nevada City reside. Now its presence in the area is a shadow of itself. Less than 100 people still work for the company in Grass Valley itself. It is now a worldwide company that, at the moment, is run out of Montreal. In fact, most likely in 2022 the company will cease to have a physical presence at all in the area.

At one time it was claimed that more people per capita worked in the television industry in this area than anywhere else on the planet, including places like New York, Los Angeles, or London. Most people who live in the local area do not know this, yet television production movers and shakers regularly made pilgrimages to the area to hobnob with the technical wizards that help make their visions a reality to this day.

The namesake company originally was called the Grass Valley Group. It dropped Group from the name many years ago. Internally the company is often referred to as the Group by 'old timers' still in the area. The brand is still so strong that many in the television industry simply refer to it as "Grass." Why the "at the moment" comment a couple paragraphs ago? As we have seen the Group has been sold into larger corporate entities, some quite large, and spun back out into holding companies and other larger players, a half dozen times, and it was recently cast out again. Several prominent players in the industry have had part or all of their company intertwined with the Group, and today it is the Grass Valley name that survives. There are DNA fragments from dozens of companies in the "Group," some that date back into the 1800s.

As we have also seen, the Group is not the only high-tech video company in the area. There were at least 15 other companies that sprang up by Group alumni, and some second-generation companies from those. Prominent local "video" companies today include Telestream, AJA, and Ensemble Designs. These names have long been known by those working in the traditional television broadcast and production industries, but now they are also known by many in Hollywood, and the general cinema industry. The "film" in the film industry is gone, and the "movie" folks have adopted many of the same tools that TV uses, albeit, often used in vastly different ways than the traditional video folks use them.

These local companies play an important role in "media" today and will for the foreseeable future, but the process of convergence in technology continues, with more and disparate segments of high-tech settling on platforms that are computers at their core. What 10-15 years ago was separate media, and networking to control media using dedicated hardware and cabling, is more and more all finding itself on the same cat 6 network cabling with some confusion to what is media and what is control and data. Or will it become all data and control?

<h2>The Pandemic</h2>
On top of this it now appears that this convergence might have been coerced into a revolution, and it might have commenced in March of 2020. Like the rest of the world, the Pandemic mantra became stay away, or at least stay apart. As this book is being written the ebb and flow of the virus and the mandates that that brings is accelerating what would most likely have come in the future. Except now that change is needed sooner, and that just might bring change in a way that, in another universe with no pandemic, would have occurred differently. It already has forced something to happen that most in the industry would have said in 2019 and before could never happen.

<h3>The Industries Meeting Place</h3>
Traditionally the technical media celebrate their Christmas season in March. The vendors, like our band of companies in the Grass Valley/Nevada City area who sell equipment to the various media, see a quarter to a third of their yearly sales happen at a four-day celebration that takes place every April. Unlike Easter, where the day is determined by the first Sunday that occurs after the first full moon after the vernal equinox, this festival was set by the availability of the palace it is held in and the available spaces at the inns that surrounded it. The kingdom over the years has grown huge. Today those lodging spaces number over 150,000.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-01_vegas_strip.jpg
The Vegas Strip

Like Mecca itself, this desert locale is a 'must' destination for many. In good years well over 100,000 make the journey. They come from over 160 countries to see the wares offered by over 1600 exhibitors like the folks from Grass Valley. Many attendees come planning to spend much treasure for the goods found there. Often over $20 billion is committed to obtaining the products and solutions on display.

Las Vegas Convention Center

To many outside this fraternity who might happen into this two million square foot bazaar, their first impression might be that of a gigantic house of mirrors. The cacophony of sounds, displays, and crowds will at first overwhelm the senses. The first day of the celebration will indeed be a crush of humanity crowding the aisles between the booths where vendors entice you into their dens. Some booths are large, over 20,000 square feet. These represent the goliaths in the game. Each are setup and cared for by a few hundred people. The middle weights take up a few thousand square feet each and usually deploy a platoon size ensemble of sales and technical folks. The small, want-to-be's, the ones occupied by a husband and wife, and maybe extended family, friends, and hangers-on, generally take up a 150-Sq ft footprint. These smaller booths are off the main drag and towards the fringe areas of the gathering. Our band of vendors from Grass Valley are found in all three of these groups most years.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-02_nab_crowds.jpg

The crush on the first day would subside each of the remaining three days, with a temperature drop in the enclosed parts of the gathering often dropping over 15 degrees by day four as the overwhelming crowd on day one became slightly sparser each day. Day one would be mainly for gawking at what new technical wonders are on display. By the third and fourth days the tire kickers give way to serious buyers who want to nail down deals. Sellers anxious to brag about having a good "show" as the gathering is called, buckle down to close as many sales as possible, and at the same time try not to give away the store.

The convention has been held solely in Las Vegas since 1991. It has about 1800 exhibitors, and over 200 lectures, panel discussions and workshops. When the economy is good over 120,000 attend.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-03_farnsworth.jpg
Farnsworth

Like the Farnsworth Air Show, where airframe and engine manufacturers of commercial and military aircraft show off their latest high-tech wonders to an astonished crowd, the same is done at this gathering. While generally not as big, fast, and noisy as what the air show outside London sees, the trinkets, tools, software, and plain old 'big iron' on display and often grandly demonstrated, can mesmerize those in attendance as much as a take-off or flyby of the newest and hottest craft above Farnsworth. The chief products offered by the vendors in the desert will be used by their buyers to inform, entice, entertain, and sometimes enrage the customer's customers, the television and movie viewer.

<h4>The Convention Itself</h4>
Welcome to the National Association of Broadcasters Convention. People who attend it refer to it simply as NAB, or the show. Held for the first time in 1923 in New York City by a radio industry still in its infancy, it bounced around to a dozen different cities over the years until it finally settled in Las Vegas in the early 90s. It is held at the Las Vegas Convention Center, about a half mile off the northern end of the strip. The overall footprint of the center is 4,000,000 square feet.

The show is so large that the largest of the vendors, names everybody knows, Sony, Panasonic, Adobe, Apple, Microsoft, plus other significant vendors that outsiders will not know, such as Grass Valley, Telestream, Black Magic, AJA, start planning for the convention months in advance. Sony's booth is so large, at 26,000 square feet it is usually the largest, that they start planning months in advance and often show up in the cavernous center a couple weeks in advance to start assembling their booth. It is not unusual for Sony to ship 40 trailers full of equipment to Vegas. Their crews are often the first on site. As is usually the case, the convention center does not pay to cool or heat the massive open spaces until right before the attendees arrive, and not so much for the vendors. Generally large portable air conditioning units are spaced around each vendor's booth area to make setup bearable. But there was a year in the 90s where it snowed in Vegas during April setup, and AC units were replaced with heaters.

NAB as an organization is generally a lobbying force for broadcasters. While television and radio stations pay annual dues based on the number of stations a company has, from $500 to several thousand dollars a year, the convention generates a large percentage of the revenue used to fund their operations. Equipment vendors can be associate members of NAB where they pay based on revenue. Mom and pop startups pay $750, while companies like Sony pay $3,500. But as a vendor you do not stop paying there. While the convention center itself charges $0.35 per square foot per day, NAB astronomically marks that up to $49 per square foot (for all four days) for members and $54 for nonmembers. Now that does include basic booth amenities as a booth backdrop, and half height space partitions, a table and a couple chairs. From there booth costs, depending on size and amenities can go up exponentially. 10 by 20 sized booths can hit $20K quickly. Need electrical or other help assembling the booth? That is easily over $100/hour per laborer. Also, if you can't carry it in or wheel it in on an extremely small hand truck, you will have to use union labor and pay a drayage fee for them to get it from the outside of the center to your booth.

The point is that the show is important to companies that sell equipment to broadcasters, but it is also a substantial investment. As was already mentioned, a large part of the attendees are not your typical radio and television broadcast types anymore, as the cinema folks have essentially eradicated the use of film, and now use many of the tools traditional TV production folks use, often in ways foreign to an old-time TV engineer. Today NAB not only bills itself as the voice for the nation's radio and television broadcasters, but the largest show for media, entertainment, and technology. "Where Content Comes to Life" is their recent tag line. They now cast quite a large net.

At the beginning of 2020, the companies in Grass Valley also were planning to introduce their latest and greatest gadgets at that year's show. Some were working on physical products, those you can touch and manipulate, without having a PC intermediate. Today, however, few products do not know how to talk to a computer. A couple companies concentrate on software only products. While stand alone, dedicated products still are churned out by television equipment vendors, many pieces of hardware and software often are bundled into a larger system. So, our merry band of companies were working on items from small boxes that do specific tasks, up to systems that will reside at the enterprise level at a client's facility and help run their business.

Because the industry's Christmas starts on a hard date in sin city, in 2020 it was April 19th, and so much of the money available from customers is offered up then, new competitive products must make it to that show. Invariably, the new product's goals and specs will not have been passed off to the engineers, who are to turn concepts into reality, until the show is much closer than the designers would have liked.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-04_editing_suite.jpg

As is often the case some products go to the show and are in reality only partially operational, and through some technical wizardry are made to appear fully capable of their intended purpose. It is like the old film adage, "we'll fix it in post." In this case they will come back from the show make it fully functional on its own, and then figure out how to build and ship it. Yes, there are products, in almost every industry, where you can build and make one work, but cannot churn them out on a profitable basis. A couple of decades ago a company in the industry developed an editing operator interface. This was a time when editors were not just applications on a computer, but often filled a room. The newly developed editing operator control was not only a technological achievement for its day, but it was also aesthetically appealing. It was something Steve Jobs would have liked. The only problem was the power it consumed equaled what an entire household used. Beautiful but un-shippable.

With the engineers toiling away, marketing and sales departments are conceiving campaigns to convince the technical and production types in the TV industry why they will need their latest widgets. Others, spread out across various departments in these companies, none of the companies in the Grass Valley area have greater than 200 people based in the area, are worried about the logistics of getting the necessary pieces and parts to the show, and ensuring that the booth is completed, and housing and travel arrangements are made for all traveling out to NAB.

<h4>The Unthinkable No More</h4>
While the engineers were looking inward towards meeting their delivery goals, the people that were looking towards Vegas saw conflicting and troubling developments. On a mild Monday morning in the second week of March 2020, sales teams at our companies were coming to face the reality that the unheard of might happen. At the end of January, the state our companies are in, California, had confirmed its first corona virus case. By February travel bans were being enacted between countries. California declared a state of emergency. Other states soon followed. Before that week was out, total worldwide corona cases hit 100,000, with confirmed cases in 90 countries. Worldwide deaths stood at 3,400. That week saw schools in half the states intent on closing.

Then for our band getting ready for NAB, lightning struck. The NAB did the unthinkable. On Wednesday March 11th, NAB pulled the plug and canceled the show, an unconceivable move up until then. The gathering place, or bazaar where so much of the industries commerce was conducted was not going to happen that year. Up to a third of the industries equipment and services are purchased during the show. This held true for the folks in the Grass Valley area also.

It became a "no brainer" as they say. On the 17th the governor of Nevada ordered all non-essential businesses closed. That included casinos, and much more importantly, hotels. Guests had to be out by the 19th. Airlines curtailed flights that week by 90%. The few in the air had few passengers, and mostly carried cargo in the bays where luggage should have been. Soon some airlines were packing packages into seats in the quest for any revenue. With approximately half of NAB attendees coming from countries outside the United States, most with travel bans from them to just about everywhere, and few airline flights to transport the ones that could still fly to Vegas, the final straw was if they got there, they would not have anywhere to stay. End of story.

Like all industries, the pandemic affected the television industry profoundly. Why this is relevant to more than just the people in the industry, is the fact that most looked to television news outlets for information, and over the coming weeks as a source of entertainment as "shelter in place" orders took effect.

Television news immediately faced the challenge of covering the corona virus pandemic while grappling with the guidelines imposed to contain that crisis. Unlike scripted TV programs and entertainment talk shows which halted production in response to the crisis, news operations needed to stay on the air to disseminate information while also trying to keep the COVID-19 outbreak from spreading. "We are committed to continuing our broadcasts and serving the public without compromising the safety of our employees," CBS News President Susan Zirinsky wrote in a memo sent to employees at the time. The virus spread in New York and hit the CBS Network Broadcast Center exceptionally hard, and they essentially shut the place down and ran the network from remote locations. Their owned and operated station in New York took on much of the network operations.

For a while, several news organizations played a shell game. If a New York studio had to be closed to be cleaned and sanitized, all the networks have control rooms and facilities in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles they can turn to as an alternative. CBS aired its morning program, normally from New York, out of Washington for a while. Their news division's streaming service CBSN started using facilities at the network's owned TV stations in San Francisco and Boston. NBC News originated some programs from London and Englewood Cliffs, N.J., where financial news service CNBC is based.

In fact the networks stepped up their coverage, including prime-time specials on the virus. One news channel went live 24-hours/daily for a while. Immediately the viewer could see how drastically the pandemic had affected the look and content of a medium that had changed little structurally since it first started broadcasting into American homes in the late 1940s. This, while playing to a near-captive audience, producing high ratings, and competing against few entertainment options outside the home.

Practicing social distancing

No studio audience  

Viewers could even see the impact on screen as anchors, correspondents and guests were practicing social distancing. This practice to prevent the spread of the virus was demonstrated on news program sets as co-hosts sat at least six feet apart. The traditional shot of the anchors, sports person, and weather forecaster coming together for a group bumper shot disappeared.

Studio audiences went missing. Late night and comedy show hosts live streamed from their homes doing webcam interviews with guests, while the theaters that housed their shows were shuttered. Stunts from performing from bathtubs to host's kids doing their dad's makeup, to backyard and basement stand ups became normal material.

The virus clamp-down hit in March just as production on pilots and episodes for entertainment shows should have begun, putting 120,000 freelance workers in Hollywood immediately out of work. Network television could not produce anything approaching a new fall season.

As a result of the pause in production, inventory, aka shows, became more valuable. Because of their production model, the traditional network's inventory was pretty bare. The networks even scoured other English-speaking countries for limited series that could be shown without subtitles. So, like everywhere and everyone else, the folks who worked in TV had to immediately find more profound and different ways to do what they did. TV has been highly resistant to structural change, but now it had to change in the way they produce content and the way we watch it.

<h2>New Workflows</h2>
Like most endeavors, TV production can include a single person working by themselves, or dozens. Our vendors up in Grass Valley were among those who created a lot of the tools that the TV industry uses, and now the industry would look towards them to fabricate new workflows. The term workflow is a fancy way of saying what needs to get done, and in what order, and by whom to produce a show, or deliverable in their vernacular.

The typical newscast, be it a local one in Topeka, or a national one out of New York, all have similar attributes. What generally changes are size: the number of the crew and the amount of equipment involved, and the size of the budget. The national newscast will consume more of everything, including money to pay the higher priced talent. Other than the terminology used between the crew, which varies a bit from one outfit to the next, a person familiar with what goes on in Topeka, would quickly sort out what they saw happening in New York.

The workflow up to March to deliver a newscast to viewers would roughly follow these steps:
The news director and producers would decide what stories they would cover that day based on their resources. Often reporters and others would pitch possible stories. While a local station might have a few reporters and video photographers, the national organization would likely have more. That would include microwave trucks and satellite trucks to produce live shots. Other sources available would be from other news organizations they are affiliated with. Often story ideas would come from local and national newspapers.

Photographers and reporters would record stories which would be sent back to the station, either by sneaker-net, or transmitted via Internet, microwave, or satellite.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-07_reporter.jpg

Editors would turn the raw footage into packaged stories, sometimes under the direction of the reporter or even the photographer. Often in smaller market stations, the reporters will edit their own stories. The on-air talent, the anchors, will often be working on a story or two of their own. In smaller operations the talent often is the editor-in-chief of the show, although the show's producer usually has the final say.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-08%20wtol.jpg
https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-08%20PCR.jpg
Studio and Control Room

The technical and operations folks in charge of cameras, studio lights, graphics, the video, and audio mix, will start to congregate towards the studio and control room about an hour out. Any live shots from the field will start to be setup about this time. During a large newscast it is not unusual for the control room to have eight to ten or more people in it, depending on that news day. The studio can easily have a half dozen or more in it.

Now suddenly, whether you went to work or not depended on several things. Were you really an essential service? Most in broadcasting had that mindset. Historically when weather and other events shutdown all else, people in broadcasting were expected to find their way into work, and the ones already there were expected to stay if needed.

But like all other situations, there were other mitigating factors. Do you really want your staff exposed in close spaces, like control rooms or news trucks? In a few cases unions stepped in and demanded spacing. Many simply got inventive on their own. Reporters started using smartphones and became their own photographer. The selfie became a legitimate production tool.

How guest interviews were handled

Other changes rapidly appeared. Most guests and contributors started appearing from remote locations outside of studios from their homes, some via Skype, many more on Zoom as its use, and stock prize skyrocketed. Broadcast and cable networks put on programs with reduced staff and producers working from home. Soon other people began working from home. The news staff at one cable network working from the studio went from 74, to two. The two were technicians to keep the core facility operational for everyone else who were now using and manipulating it remotely.

Whole television markets were now sending a lone photographer to news events such as a press conference, then sharing the video. Fewer photographers on site meant better social distancing and freeing up the other photographers to chase down more enterprising stories. At the start of the "new normal" viewers were more lenient about production values that may not have been what they were accustomed to.

<h3>Working Remotely</h3>
Working remotely is not anything new to many in television, as reporters have worked from news vans and hotel rooms for years. The big change is that over the years, television facilities central core has become data centers that can be virtually accessed over the Internet. In some cases, parts of that data center do not actually physically reside on the television facilities property. It is hosted on someone else's servers accessed by the Internet. This is the nebulous "cloud"often referred to, and now, what use to be physically associated by necessity, can now be distributed across multiple locations. Later on in this chapter we will look at that much more closely.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-10%20equipment%20racks.jpg
Traditional equipment racks

It used to be that equipment racks in television facilities were filled with specially built equipment. They were designed to do at best a few different things. They took signals in, processed, or modified them, and spit the result out for the next box down the food chain to do its thing. That happened until eventually the signal left the station and was conveyed to your TV. Today, in many cases, equipment residing in racks may look like specialized boxes or equipment, but under their covers, they are computers at heart.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-10_video_pc.jpg
These are essentially network servers

They are not just a piece of equipment that uses a microprocessor as its control system, or brains, but an out-and-out PC, albeit one with some special IO cards, and software. Yes, some do run on Windows and often are found in critical locations. Even the equipment that is still designed to do a specific thing is usually quite comfortable hanging out on a computer network. Bottom line, most equipment installed in equipment racks today, can be controlled remotely.

In the past, a station's workflows were relatively straightforward. People sat at positions dedicated to doing a distinct set of operations, such as a graphics computer, camera control position, video switching or audio mixing positions. These were dedicated machines doing specific functions. Communications being a vital part of any operation with several people interacting at once required intercom stations with multiple channels that could be easily selected from a dedicated panel.

Some of the dedicated operation positions used today
https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-11%20audio.jpg
https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-11%20Collins%20with%20Kayenne.jpg
https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-11%20config%20station.jpg
https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-11%20video.jpg

While in the past many control positions had dedicated operator or control panels, today more often than not a control station is a computer, keyboard, video monitor, and mouse, connected via a KVM switch in the system. This setup allows the duties performed by various operator positions to be easily changed based on the demands of a particular show.

With most things now hanging out on a computer network, operators that might sit at a dedicated operating station or control panel can now be decoupled, or "dematerialized" as some have described, from that location or piece of equipment. That is taking the physical association of hardware/software and moving it to a position that could be connected to or from anywhere else. It is simply remote control over a LAN, WAN, or Internet.

Workflows
https://www.lomaricatv.com/tech%20boxes.html#workflows

This means that producers, directors, and operators can control audio mixers, video switchers, and graphics from crew member's homes from around the world. During the pandemic many news reporters, anchors, or other talent had remote controlled cameras in their home that can be panned, tilted, and zoomed by someone across the globe!

This evolution had been occurring for some time. In fact, when it comes to sports production, as we will see shortly, this had been the goal for almost 20 years, culminating in workflows where many of the folks involved are not on site at the venue, but somewhere else. Only things that are necessary at the venue would be there: cameras, microphones, etc. the "acquisition" tools as they are known. As we will see groups in Grass Valley are instrumental in this development.

The obvious goal is to simplify the logistics, lowering the cost of production. The industry has a fancy acronym for this: REMI (REMote Integration model). This is also referred to as At-Home production. Originally that meant that much of the crew would be at their normal operating position, that is, at their usual place of work, no matter where the game was being done. What was not originally intended was that this evolution would suddenly turn into a revolution where people performed operations from their home, in a risky and accelerated manner.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ch9-14_remi%201.jpg
Remote Integration model (REMI)

Whereas in facility operations there use to be broadcast engineers or technicians that cared for and fed the technical center, now the IT person is first among equals. Back in the early days of television the technician often made policy decisions as to what media could air, often citing FCC rules and regulations. Way back then, the FCC tightly regulated what could be in the video payload, not only content and minimal quality, but also how the complete payload was constructed and delivered. Those restrictions have been relaxed as technology has made the viewers display much more forgiving and stable than it was even 30 years ago. Today it is usually the IT person who cites security policy in stopping what the more creative types would like to deliver.

Many facilities strive to keep their business networks separate from their media networks, with a multi-layer firewall between the two, but inadvertently these efforts are thwarted inadvertently by thumb drives and the like.

Years ago, "turnkey" facilities would often be built for a station, that is a systems integrator would build, commission, and test a facility and, when done, turn the keys over to the owner. Today facilities can be built using high powered servers, either your own, or an Internet providers, and laid on top of those servers, services with acronyms such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. In short, the differences are what the station manages in their software stack and what they pay someone else to do. More on these in a bit.

From the station managing their own software running on someone else's server, to lights out, everything is managed by someone else. The facility is simply a client or user. These services mean that even if the users are in their office, they are in effect remoted into their workflow. Better hope nothing affects your connectivity or brings the internet crashing down. Later on in this chapter we will look at the SaaS model much more closely.

As already mentioned during March and April of 2020 the cobbling together of new ways of doing things was centered around cell phones and laptop cameras, often one or the other functioning in dual capacity. They often simply setup Zoom or Skype type calls, or video conferences. In many cases back at the facility a PC that was part of the session simply fed its desktop display out into the facilities video and audio infrastructure and it went to air. A couple of companies in Grass Valley are instrumental in facilitating this.
