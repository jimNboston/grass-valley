Chapter 17 - The Future
<h2>Television, Video, and the Valley</h2>
We will wrap this tome up with a look into the future. As the book illustrated, the name of the biggest technological firm to come out of the area will no longer have a physical presence in the area. On the surface you might think that would be analogous to Philly, without cheese-steaks or cream cheese, or Denver without omelets, or Chicago without stuffed pizza.

The sad fact is that in the Grass Valley/Nevada City area today many have never heard of the Grass Valley Company. Fewer and fewer know what the "Group" refers to. The author had a doctor who had an office in Grass Valley and never new about a video industry in the area. Even fewer in the two towns know that the original Atari game console was engineered in the area. Nor the mine owner that set in motion the events the led to the area for a while claiming the moniker of "Video Valley." If it was not for that mine owner, as we saw in chapter two, there very much might have been a company originally headed by Dr. Donald Hare, but it might have evolved as the Fresno Group!

Television is sometimes referred to as the Fifth Estate. This nomenclature originated in 1380, by the theologian John Wyclif who declared that there were three estates 'ordained by God.' The first was the Clergy, followed by the Barons and Knights and lastly the Commons. Today those would equate to government, the church, and the people. In the 18th century we got the notion of the fourth estate, because of the earlier invention of the printing press. Today this is generally regarded as being the press. In 1932, The London Times reported that "radio has been called the fifth estate." That was soon extended to television. Today many argue that social networking and the Internet are now the Fifth Estate.

It is interesting that what was widely considered the Fifth Estate, broadcasting until recently, is now being supplanted by the world wide web. Not too surprising in reality, considering what we saw in the last chapter. Television, or video and audio has continually evolved. The more rapid evolution was in the technology deployed. It generally made the viewing experience better by improving the picture and sound quality and allowing the creators of programming to bring much more creativity and features to the content.

Historically though broadcasters were always slow to embrace changes that did not improve the bottom line. Many broadcasters fought furiously when they were forced to move away from analog to digital transmission. In the late 90s the author once sat in a meeting where the general manager of a station told his chief engineer that he would fire him if he caught him spending money on the process of "going digital," even though it was being mandated by the FCC.

Digital transmission meant that broadcasters could offer HD. Most early on were not interested. When they found that the new technology would allow them to transmit more than one program at once, they originally opted for "more," instead of "better quality" HD. It was ESPN in 2002 that mandated that any production company providing programming to the cable network, mainly sporting events, had to do it in HD.

Up until then the main problem facing the industry in regard to HD, was that as we have seen, there were two standards. Colloquially known as 720p and 1080i, half the networks and stations used one, and the other half the other. CBS, NBC, and PBS were the alphabet networks that use 1080i, ABC (including ESPN), and Fox where in the 720p camp. While 1080i offered more spatial resolution, 720p offers more pictures per second. ESPN and Fox, big on sports, decided more pictures were better. Much earlier we talked about interlaced video, sending half the lines of a picture at a time. With sports and all the replays this leads to slightly degraded quality, on top of the fact that there are fewer pictures per second. The P stands for Progressive. Simply means that all the lines in the picture are sent each scan.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/1920-1080%20pixels.jpg

The log jam was that since these networks contracted out all their sports production, at least equipment wise, none of those companies wanted to have to invest in two sets of equipment. Up until then cameras and other equipment, could be produced that would work in either standard, the problem was that the camera would slightly compromise the quality of the standard it was not native to. A 1080i camera would make slightly degraded pictures in 720p, and visa-versa. The industry claimed, deceptively in many cases as many did not want to invest in HD, that they would not accept video that was not generated in its native format.

Philips, before its camera division became part of the Grass Valley Company, came to the rescue. It offered a camera that they claimed was native to both. Actually this was half true. With a clever piece of engineering they made it true vertically. Horizontally, the format change was done through interpolation. This was enough for ESPN to force HD upon their vendors. HD took off.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/resolution%20comparison.jpg

With no motion in the picture 1080i & 1080p will look exactly the same. Same with 480i (what was the Standard Definition format) & 480p. 480p was a standard that Fox pushed for awhile.

Technology is now solving the two format issue, as a standard is now available that combines the higher spatial resolution of 1080i with the higher picture count of 720p, naturally called 1080p.

Going back to digital transmission, more programs verses HD issue. Technology eventually solved that problem also as compression technology improved to a point where both could be done at once.

These technological leaps are one of the reasons our band of video companies in the area are in such a tough business. New formats, as we just mentioned, seldom bring more revenue into the broadcaster. They are usually mandated by government or to stay even with the competition.

As Chuck Meyer, CTO - Production, Grass Valley Company put it: "New formats never increase revenue for broadcasters. They are compulsory requirements, or table stakes. Broadcasters must re-tool their entire facility for a new format, as each facility is developed around that format. This takes years of planning. In the meantime, a small investment is made in a trial system for the new format. For broadcast equipment manufacturers, the result is a bump in sales for these trials, followed by a lag, and then the greater market curve."

As we saw in chapter 14, a very big reason why Belden recently sold the Grass Valley Company was that it is a "lumpy" business revenue wise. There is no reliable way to meet steady earnings quarter after quarter to keep Wall Street happy.

In many ways the clientele of our band of companies is shifting. Birney Dayton, founder, and President of NVISION, which was spun off from the "group" and eventually became another company that was folded back into the Grass Valley Company, said "If you look into the broadband industry there is not much need for the broadcast industry anymore. TV delivery systems are totally unrelated to the TV industry. The satellite companies inserting the local stations, via very convoluted methods, into their channel lineup (local into local) is an artificial construct and has no fundamental need to exist. The counter argument is that you need to preserve local content, but then stations are now central casting. How is that any different than running many things out of El Segundo (DirecTV's central satellite uplink center)?"

Central casting is where a number of stations spread out geographically in various cities are run from a central location. If you walked into master control in one of these station, it is a lights out operation. In many cases there is not even a master control anymore in those stations. Consolidation through central casting is another drain on equipment sales.

Meyer says that the industry is in a format stall, and that the worldwide penetration of HD is nearing 100% of the available market. Those counting on 4K will find it will not pan out in the home as most do not have enough viewing space available to appreciate its enhanced resolution. It will mainly be used in theaters, and signage applications. The next quality improvement in receivers will most likely not be increased resolution, but what is being called Ultra HD (UHD). This will increase the accuracy of the colors displayed and increase the dynamic range between light and dark areas of the screen, but not increase the pixel count.

As we saw in the last chapter, software is replacing hardware in many cases, and that software is changing the fundamental workflows of the industry. Dan Castles, President, and a founder of Telestream says video and audio quality is not the absolute imperative it once was. Now many content producers will trade some quality for shorter time to air. Telestream creates products that allows creators/distributors to manage the trade off between time and quality.

Broadcasters have lost most of their control on program delivery and how it is viewed. Plus the barrier to entry for competition is rapidly evaporating as you do not need to make a large investment in production equipment and delivery. Today it is simply conceiving a good idea for compelling content.

Content delivery is rapidly being taken over by 5G as the "over-the-air" solution, and by GigE networking via cable connected receivers.

Even the local news and emergency alert arguments that are made to keep local over the air broadcasters transmitting now have plenty of alternative distribution paths. So the traditional broadcasting environment, actually all program content and delivery, is evolving a new set of players.

Anna Greco, Senior Vice President of Telestream Client Services says that the majority of Telestream's customers are not traditional broadcasters like they were when the company started. Traditional TV facilities are now less than 50% of their customer base.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/snf%20cameras.jpg

One thing at this point that is probably keeping the old broadcasting model together is Sports. Many wonder if politics now in sports will kill it. The majority of the viewers are middle and working class and tend to run more conservative and patriotic. The most profitable of all sports leagues is the NFL. In 2020 the networks paid a combined $6.25 billion a year to air games. Ad revenues which came in at about $5 billion. While historically the NFL has been a loss leader for the networks, with ratings down nearly 20% over the last few years many advertisers are starting to ask for rebates.

TV news, which use to be a large cash cow is also losing steam. The network morning shows, namely Today and Good Morning America (GMA), produce the majority of the revenues to fund the rest of the network's news organization. In 2019 Today brought in over $400 million, and GMA $375 million. Compare that to NBC's Nightly News which brought in $146 million, and Meet the Press, $26 million. A generation and half ago evening network news shows were appointment TV. That habit by most of the public slowly evaporated. Now the same thing is starting to happen with the flagship morning shows.

A final straw that might bring the traditional television broadcasting house of cards down is "Must Carry." That is a rule enacted by the FCC, which originally said that locally licensed television stations must be carried on a cable provider's system. That has evolved into a game of poker between the broadcasters and the cable and satellite providers. Cable systems pay most cable networks some money per subscriber. Today the highest priced cable network by far is ESPN, which commands over $7 per subscriber. That is over three times higher than the second highest network, TNT, which is over $2/sub. Most networks receive less than a dollar per month.

It is interesting that just over 20% of cable subscribers watch ESPN regularly. That means that the actual cost per viewer is well over $30/month.

Broadcasters and cable/satellite providers in dispute

Eventually the local stations, backed up by their networks, if they were affiliate with one, turned the table on the cable and satellite distributors and started negotiating carriage fees for themselves. Since the local affiliates were the gatekeepers for ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, and a few other smaller over the air networks they had leverage. Most local stations manage to get between $1 and $1.50. All this adds up and explains why many cable and satellite subscribers pay over $100 a month for service. Partially because of the high and still rising cost, many are "cord cutting," getting rid of their cable service. 6.2 million subscribers canceled their service over the 2019-2020 year. If the networks ever decide that local affiliate stations, cable, and satellite service is not worthwhile, and decide to go the Netflix distribution route, that will leave no rational for most broadcasters to continue.

"Cord cutting" usually means not the total elimination of cable service, just the cable companies legacy television distribution service. Many cord cutters keep the Internet part of the service. This is leading to what is called Over The Top (OTT) subscription service. Netflix Internet service is OTT. Some of the network late night shows are starting to format segments of the shows for YouTube or subscription viewing. Other shows are following suit. The networks, both on air and cable only, until recently did not want to allow subscription viewing of their programs, as they wanted to protect the revenue they got from the cable and satellite providers and not make it easy to cord cut. Now with cable subscriptions dropping anyway, many are rethinking the subscription models.

Broadcasters are actually now starting to rethink their "over-the-air" business model. In 2012 the FCC set up a convoluted auction system where stations could offer to turn in their current channel and move to a new one. The goal by the FCC was to carve out increased spectrum for wireless services. Broadcasters had a similar thing happen in 2009 when Sprint paid to give broadcasters new gear for their 2GHz microwave equipment to free up 5 MHz of bandwidth for their cell service. The pressure to get broadcasters to give up their channels will continue to grow as wireless and cell service continue to explode.

It should be noted that the losers when the traditional "over-the-air" transmission of television finally ceases will be those in the lower social-economic rungs of the ladder. "Old fashion" TVs connected to antennas is still the cheapest way to receive television programming for many in that situation.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/data%20centers.jpg

Another loser will be the environment. No, not in a dramatic observable way, but power consumption overall will rise. Data centers consume vast amounts of power. IP routers takes eight times the power of a TV router. Big IP routers are not cheap to buy or run. Also with the increased speeds available through todays networks the data rates will keep increasing. Faster clock speeds mean increased power consumption as we mentioned in chapter 8. Not only in the generation and distribution of programming content, but also the power consumption at the viewing device, be it a regular receiver, or a phone.

As mentioned the clientele that the video band of companies in the area serve is radically changing. A big new customer base is the Cinematography industry. It is a different business that is now using the same technology as the television folks. The broadcast industry uses cinematography as it always has, for programming. Primetime feature shows are often a cinema product using traditional TV for distribution. This implies that in the future if networks wanted to, they could enter and compete with cinema. This also means that the cinema business could bypass the networks through their use of Content Delivery Networks (CDN). This is actually already being done by Netflix and others by their production of their own content.

Absolutely no film required!

The whole video industry has become so divergent and convoluted that the NAB has not been about traditional TV in about 25 years. The industry has changed so much that today it is alien to many old timers in the industry.

While Grass Valley/Nevada City is no longer a television Mecca, it will continue on as a high tech center. Grass Valley is still considered one of five premiere video centers in the world. 
***********************************************************************
What are the other 4? 
***********************************************************************
The video industry employed around 2000 here at its height, making it per-capita, the highest area in the world with people working in the industry. The Grass Valley Company employed over 900 people in the area alone. Today the number working in high tech is around 500.

In an effort to turn the areas fortunes around The Green Screen Institute was formed. It enlisted an advisory board that includes executives from companies like Samsung, EA, Fandango, and active virtual reality investors. Their mission is to fund entrepreneurs who will create software or content that will form the basis of successful virtual reality businesses.

<h2>Technically can the area stay relevant?</h2>
While a fairly robust technology colony still exists in the towns, it faces a number of existential threats, both internal and external to the area. From glacial forces in technology and business, to state and community issues, and even threats to the area from mother nature, and the 800 pound gorilla in this arena is not earthquakes, it's fire! We will see this shortly.

But technical relevance still looms large. Del Parks, President of Technology for the Sinclair Broadcast Group and others have said that TV needs better pixels and not more, as we have already mentioned. What that means is 2K resolution for the home is good enough. What is needed is more dynamic range and color space. HDR (High Dynamic Range). Plus new wider color space (Wide Color Gamut or WCG) which gives more shades and tints of colors like green. Humans evolved being very sensitive to shades of green, especially at night. It helped us gleam what was dangerous in the brush.

Only nations like the U.S. would have enough living space to sit far enough away to benefit from 4K pixels instead of 2K. Now many are arguing that 1080P HDR is what will become the new standard.
************************************************************************
Where is this additional color/gamma space put? Is the bitrate upped some?
************************************************************************
A good thing with stopping the pixel count at 1080p is that it will lessen the bandwidth demand on the Internet, which allows for more users, which equates to broadcasters and content providers making more money.

And a company like NetFlix, can now produce its own content, and send it Over The Top (OTT) to the home. As recently mentioned, OTT is the use of Internet service only to view media, and not using any traditional "channelized" service like cable or satellite. There is no need to wait for a broadcaster to deploy UHD/HDR/WCG to provide this picture upgrade. The sets are for sale now and very affordable. A 65" LG OLED providing 4k, HDR and WCG can be purchased today for more than 50% less than its HD, 2k predecessor when HD first rolled out in 1998.

There is no format stall in the traditional sense. There is no barrier to entry based on format and protected regulatory status. There are screens, cameras, recorders, and cloud storage, all deployed today. All are ready to support 4K, HDR, and WCG. In contrast to the roll out of HD, where the broadcaster was essentially first, screens were expensive, and content was scarce. This time screens are cheap, content is widely available, and the broadcaster is essentially last.

The stall is with the broadcasters, because they need to determine their new world business model as their power to control advertisement value has been severely diminished. In 2014, Linear, or appointment, that is traditional TV viewing, was eclipsed by some combination of time-shifting, near Video On Demand (VOD), VOD and streaming, most of which is OTT today. In 2016, Advertising spent on digital media eclipsed that of linear, or traditional, TV.

To quote Chuck Meyer, "What is disrupting Broadcast? It is not IP. It is what IP technology enables."

This is a total refactoring of their business model. It is disruptive to nearly every aspect of their business. Companies like Grass Valley, whose primary customer needs to redefine how they do business so as to recover and make a profit on the content they create. They must also be able to monetize, in as many new ways as possible to cover the cost of live sports, today the priciest of all programming.

How to move to this new brave world? The business could take the inexpensive, it's good enough route. Such as using inexpensive Adobe software which can do everything a switcher can do. Just not in real time and with as many channels.

Or broadcasters can buy into the GV universe by investing in AMPP (Agile Media Processing Platform), what the company calls a scalable SaaS platform. This platform, or ones like it, would have everyone writing their applications to it. Much like Xerox did when they started in the late 50s, you did not buy copiers, you bought copies, and rented the machine. Grass Valley is thinking that their platforms would be rented by the hour.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/atsc%203.jpg

The advent of ATSC 3.0 is likely to be too late to be much of a factor in the broadcaster's new business model. Competing data services such as 5G and LEOS (Low Earth Orbit Satellite) GigE, will provide ubiquitous, high bandwidth to the home. Why buy something that only provides TV? Why buy limited data services from a smaller pool of providers? The consumption of video is no longer on a particular device, or a device in a particular mode. It is simply another form of data.

Even providing Emergency Public Service announcements and information is not a monopoly of traditional radio and TV anymore. 5G and LEOS can provide much more resilient transmission to PDA/Cellular devices. The verdict is out on what happens to broadcasters' tall towers and high powered transmitters. Will they find a way to be relevant and not just become scrap metal?

What happens to the traditional Content Delivery Networks (CDN) like cable and satellite. Do you even need scheduled delivery of content anymore? Are the Amazon Prime and Netflix delivery on demand to become the new model. Outside of sports and breaking news there are few "discussions around the water cooler" must see events anymore.

Companies like the ones in this book will increasingly peddle data driven automation capability, which will use local data to optimize the workflow of the various content providers. That optimization of workflow will have to be done through machine learning, by analyzing data, and optimizing a given process or an hierarchy of processes. The new "big four" prime time broadcasters will need networks of systems to deliver content, millions of streams of programming that can adapt on the fly, without the necessity of a traditional traffic and master control operations.

That is at one end of the spectrum, the other is a single person who becomes a media caster overnight. While this is not new, attesting to all the YouTube and tick-toc channels, the new technology will allow those type folks to greatly ratchet up their game, or even more easily collaborate between groups of them.

This means the vast majority of future products from the likes of Grass Valley will be software, running on generic, but very powerful hardware platforms. Outside of that there will be generic user panels, joysticks, etc. Years ago Grass Valley had a product that would allow one model switcher's control panel to control other model of switcher. Non-off-the-shelf hardware will only be found in the most demanding applications, where power is precious, rack space is a premium, and latency considerations for human interaction determine the workflow.

Back to the common platform problem, is that with SAAS is that you have to go through a revenue trough and get to the other side. As we already mentioned a few times, but worth repeating, customers will not generally pay what software is worth. They will pay for things they can touch, things that have mass. The software to control that hardware, was often just thrown in. Now almost, or all of the physical surfaces that a production person touches might all be someone else's keyboard or joystick

This means there will be a new Microsoft, Google, Apple, or Facebook, in television production. Maybe one of them! Who will it be? The one(s) who are early to market and can either saturate or control a significant percentage of the market, then commoditized it, making it hard for others to enter in a big way, and finally one, or possibly a few will monopolize the market. Jobs was the first with the iPhone. Apple still has the largest "app' store.

<h2>The China Problem</h2>
Let us start with an overseas gorilla that has taken over a large part of the electronics industry and has very different agendas than what the area grew up dealing with. Asia has been a challenge to the U.S. electronics industry for a long time. An interesting stumble from grace includes Dell, whose original business model was to sell directly to end users through the Internet. But as the market moved more towards tablets, Dell's efforts fell short in that area, and all the PCs coming out of Asia, especially China, put Dell in a race to the bottom profit wise. A race to the bottom with China was a losing proposition. As others have done to find a survival strategy, it could have offered something China did not, provide end to end service that many larger customers now want, but Dell decided not to. As we will see shortly, a small company just down the road from Grass Valley found a way to take the manufacturing behemoth on.

Most hardware-only products face the risk of them being commoditized. A prime reason for this is the development of cheap shipping. This changed how the development of products are done, and how companies are organized. In the early 80s China took prime advantage of that. China opened four areas for foreign investment with less than normal government oversight.

The one that exploded to the top is the city of Shenzhen. In 1980 it was a town of 30,000. Today it has 18 million inhabitants. It might be the fastest growing city in human history. It lies just north of Hong Kong. Now Shenzhen is the electronics manufacturing capital of the world. It is known as the "Silicon Valley for Hardware." It is also called the "hardware capital of the world." Sony, Samsung, Apple, Microsoft, Canon all manufacture in the city. It is claimed that 90% of the world's electronics are made, in part, in this city.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/Shenzhen.jpg
Shenzhen

Shenzhen is now part of the world's largest megalopolis, which covers a significant part of China's manufacturing heartland and includes the cities of Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Foshan and Dongguan. This area has a greater population than Argentina, Australia, or Canada.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/Shenzhen%20map.jpg

What made this city ground zero? In the beginning it was simple economics that drove this. Where a U.S. plant would pay $15/hr in labor, Chinese plants would pay $3/hr. But everything was cheaper. In Shenzhen, a full meal is still $3. China holds down the exchange rate. This means western economies can buy more. China does not tax exports and the US does not generally tax imports. The US does not charge custom fees on some imports, although now they are taxing some ICs & semiconductors.

China made it easy to invest there. Many venture-capital firms targeted the area. At least one has targeted hardware startups and has setup a hardware accelerator and incubator facility. Shenzhen got here from its manufacturing roots, which created a technologically adept labor pool, and because of this critical mass a very close supply network. Since Shenzhen is in the center of suppliers the supply chain is shorter. Also, all the intelligence that leaks out of all the companies here allows companies to respond quickly to new trends. The city leads China in patent applications. Of all the world this is where the hardware ecosystem has jelled the most. Designers, manufacturers, wholesalers, and shippers have formed a complete ecosystem.

Whereas prototyping elsewhere often takes 4-5 weeks, in Shenzhen it takes only a few days and often at a quarter of the cost as elsewhere. Years ago, National Semiconductor spent two years to develop a new chip, a company overseas took only six months to reverse engineer it.

Because cash has long been a favorite burglary target, and people are less and less likely to have lots of it in the house, electronic devices used to be at the top of a thief's list. But a recent property-loss statistic from the Federal Bureau of Investigation claims that today's electronics devices make for less attractive burglary targets than those of past decades because they quickly become out-of-date.

Many foreigners come from around the world to spend time in Shenzhen to develop their products, helped by the support structure that has been assembled here.

Shenzhen now has one of the largest container ports in the world, and UPS has their Asian shipping hub at the Shenzhen airport. In addition, two cargo airlines, along with two Chinese passenger airlines are based at the airport.

But it is not only electronics, companies like Alibaba have large sheet metal fabrication operations here. Makerfabs, a large printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturer, has operations there also. The area can build complete products in a very short time.

But prosperity in Shenzhen is pushing prices up there and as manufacturing is becoming more automated, some of that automated manufacturing will move back home. But that does not spell doom for the area as the electronics industry there is moving up the food chain and are increasing innovation and branding of their own. We have seen these centers move before. So, no matter where you are, you better figure out what your value added is.

Until recently much of what came out of China was called Shanzhai products. There are two explanations of the term. One came from Cantonese slang, Shanzhai factory, that meant products from an ill-equipped, low-end family based outfit. The second might be based on Shenzhen. Shenzhen started its electronics legacy by building imitation or knock-off products designed by others. Again, it is suggested that people who speak mandarin Chinese with a Cantonese accent sounded like they were saying Shanzhai product instead of Shenzhen product.

So, as we have mentioned already, places like Shenzhen rode the first wave of electronic innovation, the commoditization of parts. The second wave is the creation of whole platforms, that is complete development boards, what the Chinese call gong ban, or public board. These can be incorporated into another's products directly or the user can build atop it via modifications. Many boards are developed that cater to smartphones, tablets, smart watches, smart homes, or industrial controls, to name a few.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/public%20board.jpg

Today these boards are often referred to as Shanzhai also. These boards are often created by parts manufacturers to ease the introduction of their products into the marketplace, or even by parts distributors to increase their sale of the parts they handle. This new use of Shanzhai allow features that mainstream civilization might dismiss. Such as multiple SIM cards in phones for frequent travelers, or phones with multiple speakers and mics so more than one can talk over a single connection or slimmed down features for those who cannot literally afford all the bells and whistles. These platforms or public boards allow for products that have limited distribution as you do not have the cost of designing from scratch and can more readily be customized.

So, what does Shenzhen have to do with the Grass Valley area, besides the fact that there is a good chance parts in locally produced products came through there? Engineers and designers in the area must keep in mind that their value-added proposition is the intellectual property that can be integrated into the product. Unless it is a very large organization, that can do its own fabrication, it most likely is not going to be the hardware that makes a widget compelling, it is how it does what it does that counts. The Grass Valley area cannot offer many "me too" products that might have wider appeal, because if they do not have a way to make it cheaper in six months, the commodity providers will swamp their efforts in research, and manufacturing prowess in short order. Large companies like Xiaomi, and Huawei have most everything in-house and can quickly integrate many features that were in separate products and suddenly your neat stand-alone box is part of someone's smart phone or other platform.

The Chinese iterate many times until they get a manufacturing sample and then copy it a million times. Hard design is a small part of that process. You cannot afford this in low volume/high mix manufacturing that companies in the Grass Valley area engage in.

Local companies have used Asia for manufacturing. Thomson, which owned the Grass Valley Company for a number of years, had everything made in Vietnam. The problem is that this is only economical if you make many, not a few, which companies in the Grass Valley area do not do. If you are building offshore a few ECOs (Engineering Change Orders - namely to fix mistakes) that crop up can throw any savings right out the window.

Since companies in the area have a low volume/high mix group of products, they need to achieve economic manufacturing with a quantity as low as one. They need to make one of something and also make money at the same time.

If a local company ever did develop a trans-formative product that was in demand by millions, and it could be easily duplicated by others, it would have no choice but to manufacture it somewhere else. David Paul Gregg invented the CD, which was amazing and changed history. But you have probably never heard of him because CDs are not difficult to make, and lost relevance over time. Most things work this way. As soon as a smart product or business idea becomes popular, the urge to copy it, and commoditize it, is the strongest force economics can unleash. Jeff Bezos summed this up when he said, "Your margin is my opportunity."

It is no accident that much of Apple's manufacturing happens in and around Shenzhen. First, the city is strategically placed, serving as the gateway between mainland China and Hong Kong. It is one of the largest shipping centers in the world, with a massive container port.

Second, the Chinese government established Shenzhen as the first Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the country. SEZs are designed to encourage enterprise through relaxed planning regulations and generous tax incentives and, crucially, to facilitate foreign investment in local companies. It is this, as much as its geographical advantages, which has enabled it to grow at such a pace.

Third, that SEZ was established way back in 1980, meaning that the city has had over 40 years to grow into the manufacturing center of the tech world. Apple relies on a huge network of suppliers and sub-contractors, some of which may make just a single tiny component. The majority of them are based in Shenzhen and its immediate surroundings, so the logistics of bringing everything together in one place for assembly are straightforward.

But we will close with Apple in a potential bind in China. A couple financial constraints including that almost 2⁄3rds of their revenue and profits come from the iPhone. Again almost 2⁄3rds of their revenue comes from two countries, 43% from the U.S., and 20% from China. But the high markup that Apple has placed on their iPhones is pricing out many loyal customers in China. With premiums so high it is allowing local competitors to charge their own comfortable premium, at a price still less than Apple.

In recent years with new, much more strict Chinese leadership, Apple's situation in the country has gotten much more complicated. Apple, more than any other company, has been vulnerable to the government's harder line. In 2001, right after China was admitted to the World Trade Organization Apple began manufacturing there. Over the years Apple executives have had to compromise their stated principles, and to placate the local authorities and has aided the Chinese government's vast censorship operation of its citizens.

Over the years the Chinese government spent billions of dollars paving roads, recruiting workers, and building factories, power plants and employee housing to help create Apple's supply chain.

But now it is under pressure to do more to conform to the Communist Party's wishes. Partially, this was done by the government imposing laws that the company could not practically obey. In response to this Doug Guthrie, once one of America's leading China supporters, said in a New York Times article, "This is the point. You are supposed to be out of compliance. Not so they can shut you down, but so you'll figure out what they want you to do and figure out how to do it."

But there are more systemic issues in dealing with China. During the pandemic it quickly became apparent that China had cornered the PPE market. At times U.S. companies like 3M and Perkin Elmer, with manufacturing plants in China, were not allowed to export products back to the U.S.. Companies that were trying to manufacture PPE in the U.S. had to face predatory pricing from China. The ubiquitous cotton mask, which cost about seven cents to make, were being dumped in the U.S. for about a penny each. But as the pandemic wore on, it was not always low prices, at one point price gouging was engaged in. The state of California found itself paying $3 for N95 surgical masks, which cost about 75 cents to make, because of a China instituted shortage.

About 20 miles south of Grass Valley, also on highway 49, is the town of Auburn. Near the city's airport is an impeccably landscaped property behind a black rod iron fence, with a large pond. A sign on the front fence says welcome to Auburn, A bird sanctuary. There are 312 birds on about five acres of property. In the pond are 3000 Koi. There are many social events held on the property.

The property sits in a 253 acre industrial park, whose largest tenant is now PG&E, the local power provider. The largest employer in the park was at one time laser manufacturer Coherent Inc. It once employed 800 employees at a four-building campus. By 2009 those buildings were empty and are now gone as PG&E tore them down.

That building with all the birds and fish is eco-friendly also. The owner has made a big investment in clean energy, with a roof-mounted system of solar power panels, covering the acre-and-a-half-size roof of its building. The panels paid for themselves within four years of installation and now returns excess power to the grid.

The company's dedication to clean air and clean energy also includes:
• Setting aside four acres of land to be free from development, then creating a pond that supports area wildlife.
• Designing an environment with as much natural lighting as possible, which has the added benefit of giving employees views of the pond and wildlife while working.

Besides doubling as a wildlife haven, the property is home to Ceronix. It is a company that competes directly with the Asian, including China's, gaming industry. It has thrived for many years, as the owner of the company, Don Whitaker, found ways to compete. He does it not by manufacturing overseas. While at one time it was a totally vertically integrated company, today they manufacture just about everything but printed circuit boards, in that lone building.

Don worked at the University of California, Berkeley for 10 years as a machinist and tool die maker. He started a company on the side called Kevex (1000 Electronic Volt Ex-Ray). He was working in the group at the university that invented a detector that through Xray and fluorescence, detected the elements in the periodic table. That expensive machine only output was into an oscilloscope. Don and another researcher modified a Sony receiver to display that output in color, and with four others formed a company.

The company grew to 300 employees. It branched out into other products. At one point they developed their own Xray tube, a division which Don ran in Scott's Valley, near Santa Cruz. Besides Scott's Valley the company also had facilities in Foster City, Burlingame, and San Carlos, all cities along the west shore of the San Francisco Bay.

The company went public, and the stock went up 20:1. Perkins Elmer came in and wanted to buy, but Don did not want to sell it, but his four other partners did. Don was 37 at the time. So he sold his house in a couple days for more than it was worth on top of a hill in San Mateo. Went in to quit and got talked into staying for two years during the transition, and he also got a bonus to buy another house, which he did in Foster City. Perkins Elmer moved the company to Texas in 79, due to the cost of doing business in California, even way back then.

Don moved up to the Sierra foothills between Auburn and Grass Valley and retired. On a trip to Las Vegas he saw an early video poker machine. It used a modified Sony receiver, something he knew about. The problem that the company offering the gaming console had was that Sony would change the design every few months. Don had been looking into building a component video monitor while at Kevex but when they were bought out the new company said no one would be interested in his monitor.

He approached the consoles manufacturer, Fortune Coin and said he was close to having a monitor ready. Asked how long before Fortune could have them Don said 4 months. He got an order for 1000. Don called up the designer he had worked with, who also happened to be living in Auburn. They finished the design in Don's garage and kitchen table. then moved into a 3000 square foot metal building near his present building and started manufacturing.

He started the company with $577K. To finance that he cashed out his 401K, mortgaged his paid off house, and maxed out 19 credit cards to bootstrap the company. He soon had many other clients, and his company partnered with another company to develop capacitive sense touch panels, which was a large improvement over available resistive panels at the time. These ended up in thousands of gaming machines.

As mentioned at one time Ceronix was a fully vertically integrated manufacturer, which included stuffing their own boards, with auto insertion (threw hole - before surface mount) equipment. When heavy microprocessor use came about, which by then were all surface mount, he found he needed to invest in all new equipment. He decided to opt out of PCB assembly in 2005 and sold the equipment he had to the Chinese.

In the early 2000's everyone in the display business were reducing prices to compete with the Asians, especially the Chinese, as they were determined to take over that business. The Feds brought some relief in 2007 by bringing a lawsuit against the Asian companies for collusion and seven top executives of Asian companies went to prison in Lompoc California. This episode only cost the Asian companies $38 million in fines. In effect they lost the battle but eventually ended up winning the war. Today there are not any monitor manufacturers except Ceronix still in the US.

By the mid-90s the Chinese, and other Asian companies had come to dominate the CRT market. In response the U.S. Government put a 15% duty on CRTs, and also wiring harnesses. Ceronix was getting its CRTs from China, as U.S. sources had dried up. But while CRTs had tariffs, incredibly to this day there is no duty on a completely assembled video monitor with a CRT or other display installed. So Ceronix went through the efforts to get the Port of Sacramento (Auburn is 25 miles northeast of Sacramento; and yes Sacramento is a sea-going port 79 nautical miles northeast of San Francisco) to apply for and receive authorization to make the 21 acres around Ceronix a Free Trade Zone (FTZ).

This allowed Ceronix to bring CRTs, and later LCDs and LED displays, in duty free and convert the commodity status of a display into a video monitor, so now it is in a different harmonized tariff schedule. So Ceronix is under an inverse tariff where individual parts cannot be brought in and sold without a tariff but completely assembled video monitors can (inverse duty). This was a savings for Ceronix at one time of over $1 million/yr.

Companies like Walmart often have warehouses in FTZs so that they do not pay duty when it comes in from overseas but is deferred until they ship it out. It is a cash flow issue. They do not pay duty until the retail, not the wholesale level requests it. There are 186 active FTZs in the United States. More than 2,900 companies currently utilize the program. FTZs provide significant advantages for U.S. based firms. Duty Deferral: Customs Duties are paid only if and when goods are transferred out of the Zone and into U.S. Customs territory. Foreign Trade Zones allow companies to bring items onto US soil without paying the duty tax, allowing them to store these goods free of tariff charges, or use parts to manufacture a finished product that can then be exported without the US import/export surcharges.

This led to Ceronix's unique business plan. Today their main business is providing replacement gaming machines to casinos; and they do that on 24 hours' notice. Ceronix specializes in short lead time replacement of gaming machines because the revenue lost by the casino is greater than the premium paid to get a replacement, and to do that Ceronix needs to maintain a high inventory, which many large companies would consider a bad investment. Today the company is a $10 million/yr company with $8 million in inventory at any given time.

Ceronix's largest customer now is a kiosks company (Coin Cloud). They do all the ones for Bitcoin. While they cannot be competitive with the Chinese in the kiosk market, they compete in higher quality and short lead times and small batch orders. The Chinese normally require hundreds, even thousands of orders before they will build.

At its height, the company got up to 105 employees. And was producing 150K CRT systems a year. Now putting out 25-30K flat display panel systems per year with 22 employees. The company is as profitable as they were when they were doing the 150k.

Ceronix can't compete with the Chinese business model – high volume, low cost, OK quality, 1 and 2 year warranties, long lead times (6-8 weeks), with his business model of low volume, no backlog, generally shipping that day any orders before 10am. The company has no order backlog. The only orders beyond the next day are ones for large orders such as an order for 100 kiosks. When that happens Ceronix will build 50 the first week and 50 for the following week. Although often they would just build them all that week. From the time they start kitting an order to the time it is ready to ship is 2 hours. They average building about 100 units a day, sometimes 150. Each of their 520 products have different kitting situations. Ceronix is a very small and niche version of the Amazon model. Almost all of their products are under $1K, with the average around $550. Why does this work? The average gaming machine makes $450/day. It is often easier just to replace it then repair it.

Don admits that it is a crazy business model. He says no one wants to develop a similar business model because of the upfront inventory cost. The cost of developing the 520 products they offer is steep. But now with the company in a sustaining phase the company does continually receive offers to sell. So it seems that while most would not want to have to build up the company over the years with the long term investment in engineering and inventory, now that it is done, ongoing returns has invited the interest of others.

From an accounts receivable standpoint many of the company's customers are casinos. If a casino is slow to pay, they can be reported to the gaming commission who can suspend their license to operate if they are determined to be in financial distress. Kiosks are a different story. They take longer to pay. But the bottom line is that the company only has a few thousand dollars in bad debt per year.

We have alluded to the difficulties in dealing with Nevada County earlier and will touch on that a little more in this final chapter. But let us add a little antidotal evidence here. Auburn is in a different county than Grass Valley/Nevada City, it is in Placer County. While Ceronix's first building was in Auburn, Placer County, Don lived in Nevada County, about 8 miles north of Auburn. When it came time to expand he looked at moving the operation to Nevada County. He looked at a number of sites in Nevada County, even part of the Bitney Springs site at one point. He also looked at three other places in the county. He even put $20K down on one location but could not get the county to sign off on the necessary permits. So he ended up staying in Placer County in the Auburn area.
