<h1>Chapter 11 - Pulling the company down</h1>
<h2>Late to the 3rd revolution</h2>
<h3>Slow to Digital</h3>
Digital video reached critical mass in the 90s, but it had been around for 20 years. The BBC did some of the earliest research into digital video in the mid-70s. But digital video had been making inroads into products at that time. The first area was digital control systems for products. Those started to show up back in the 60s, and by the end of the 70s analog controls were giving way to digital Boolean logic, and the use of ICs.

Another major development that pushed digital control forward was the development of the first microprocessor by Intel in 1971. By the end of the 70s there were a number of well known, at the time, microprocessors from a number of vendors. One that really took off was known as the 6502, which found its way into early Atari, and Apple products in 1977. While the first microprocessor, the 4004, was four bits, the 6502 (introduced in 1975) and a slew of others soon touted 8-bits. By the end of the 70s Motorola had a 16-bit microprocessor.

About this time microprocessors started to find their way as the central control systems in television products. RCA produced the first computer operated and setup camera in 1979, the TK-47. It used an 8-bit RCA Cosmac 1802 microprocessor. Even this early, and many claimed, not very capable microprocessor, allowed the camera to do things none had done before. Using a computer within allowed the camera to not only setup itself up in a minute, but allowed for much finer adjustments, and a lot more of them, then was possible before. While there were a couple adjustments that humans could do better than the automatics, it would get those adjustments close.

But when it came to registration, required of image tube cameras, but not in the coming CCDs, the automatic system was hands down better than any human. The author once watched a video operator attempt to manually setup a TK-47 at a Paul Anka concert in the 80s for ABC, as he said he did not need to rely on any computer to do his job. He worked hours to setup the four TK-47s in use. As the show time got close the producer was yelling at the engineer in charge about why all the cameras looked so bad, and they did. The engineer responded that if he was allowed to touch the camera controls he could fix it in minutes. Being a union situation a standoff occurred. As the show got closer the union steward finally realized that the show was in actual jeopardy if the situation remained unchanged. In addition the engineer reasoned that while he could not operate the camera controls, it was his job to fix broken cameras. Finally he was allowed. It took 6 button pushes and about two minutes. The cameras were fixed!

In 1982 Philips, who's camera line eventually became part of the Group, produced their first microprocessor controlled camera.

Other digital building blocks were starting to emerge around 1980. A big one was the Ethernet, and the IP protocol, which was being developed by a consortium that included DEC, Xerox, and Intel. Actually Xerox had been using a proprietary version in some of their machines since 1974. At the time it ran on coax and was used to eliminate bundles of control cables between large copier subsystems, with a single cable. Eventually the interconnect cables between switcher control panels and the central electronics frames were replaced by the modern iteration of Ethernet, "cat 5" cables.

As we will see, most facilities evolved into digital one island at a time. With equipment that was digital internally to begin with. Eventually keeping it digital as video traveled from one box to the next. In time the islands became a "continent." In a way the same thing happened to the Group. In 1984 they bought their first subsidiary, Dubner Computer Systems. Dubner added character generators, and video paint box graphics systems for television to the Grass Valley Group product line. Dubner Computer systems had multiple products from Credit Union software to lottery systems, along with hardware and software products for the television industry.

The founder, Harvey Dubner (right) was an engineer and mathematician who was noted for his contributions to finding large prime numbers.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/dubner%20emmy%20tech%20week.jpg
He worked closely with a Canadian company, Colorization, Inc to develop software for his animation systems that would allow it to colorize black and white movies and programs. In 1986 Dubner was presented with its second Emmy for its work advancing the process. This was one of the first digital islands within the company. But we will see shortly that it was not the only one. The Dubner brand was eliminated in 1991.

<h4>The first digital boxes</h4>
Because of the fragile nature of the color signal in the old analog video systems, VTRs presented a heightened problem because of the mechanical nature of VTRs. While there was a trick that fixed the problem, as we saw in chapter 9, it lowered the video quality, by producing what appeared to be "fuzzy" color. Actually the heterodyne process, as it was known, made the color stable, but not the black & white or monochrome part of the signal. Since the TV receiver locks to the monochrome, it gives the appearance that it is the chroma that is fuzzy. But the heterodyne process was not allowed by the FCC to be transmitted by broadcast stations.

VTRs were an early beach head for digital video technology. To begin with Sony as early as 1977 began research into recording video on video tape as digital information. A lot of the future standards adopted for digital video were worked out during digital VTR research. An important one was what would be the sampling rate for turning analog video into digital data. It was a tricky proposition, as the three predominant analog standards at the time were NTSC, PAL, and SECAM, all with different color subcarrier schemes. Eventually the common denominator sampling rate was determined to be 13.5MHz. The Consultative Committee for International Radio (CCIR), now the International Telecommunication Union produced Recommendation 601. Standard definition digital video went by a number of monikers, one was simply 601. The video recording format that used 601 became known as D1.

There is another reason digital video was associated with VTRs. VTRs recorded and recovered video information using a mechanically spinning head. As such, these devices were continuously running a little faster or slower than desired. This velocity error, as it was called, would play havoc with video timing, especially for the color subcarrier embedded in the video. This was caused by the fact the scanner and capstan can never exactly duplicate the exact conditions found when recording or match the playback video to "house" video, which is used as the external video reference. To even out the playback, the video was converted to digital, marched into memory at the varying rate it was arriving in from the VTR, and marched back out at a steady rate that matched the required timing of the facility housing the VTR. This device was known as a Time Base Corrector or TBC. Before this, elaborate banks of electronics with lots of variable capacitance were used to produce adjustable delay lines. These pre-TBC subsystems were large and very finicky, and only had a small correction window.

In 1975 a company called Consolidated Video Systems offered the first digital TBC. Technology had gotten to the point where memory was cheap enough, the components to convert video from analog to digital, and back again had gotten fast enough to handle analog video.

More on TBCs

A signal coming in from an outside source, satellite, microwave, the network, etc. while very close in frequency, if not exactly the same as yours, and they never were, than you could not use it in any effect. Even if the signal was at the exact same frequency, it would still be out of time with the local signal, as much as 524 lines.

So a news microwave truck out in the field to do a live report, even if it could lock to the stations signal, it still would be out of time due to the propagation delay from the truck back to the station. The fix up until then was a bad one, lock the whole station, called genlocking, that is lock your sync generator reference to the signal coming in. Worked, but all the stations sources would hiccup every time the station went into genlock, and again when coming out. Any VTR that was in record would come unlocked and depending on the generation of VTR, could take four or five seconds to relock. A big disturbance in the video. Thus there was a market to fix this, and what is called the "frame sync" was born. That is it took a whole video frame and locked it to the station's reference.

Soon it occurred to engineers that you could start to manipulate the entire digitized picture. In 1979 Vital Industries filed for a patent to do just that.

<h4>DVE's</h4>
When digital effects first burst onto the scene with Vital Industries' Squeezoom Digital Video Effects, or DVE, around 1980, production changed forever. While the Group was still struggling with the 300, which would also greatly change production, they were squarely still in the analog realm, while others were launching into the digital realm.

Until then, it was not possible to manipulate the size of a frame, let alone perform dynamic effects on it. The Squeezezoom did just that, it could squeeze a whole frame of video into a smaller size and position it anywhere on the screen. That video could then be keyed over another video source. It could also zoom into video and enlarge a portion of the video frame. This was not used much because analog video rapidly looked bad as you enlarged it.

Yes, this all seems rudimentary now as video is easily manipulated on any desktop or laptop with $49 software. But back then 16-bit microprocessors where the norm, with 32-bit ones just arriving on the scene. The high end ones employed under 70,000 transistors and ran at clock speeds of 10 MHz. Today, run-of-the-mill microprocessors bring hundreds of millions of transistors to bare and run well over 1 GHz. Today microprocessors can handle video, magnitudes of order in quality above what was available then, and in real time. Throw in desktops with dedicated graphic processors to assist, and what is inexpensive and common place today, was astronomically complex and expensive then.

Long time television engineers at the time were dumbfounded when they first encountered the DVE. Many an engineer that was involved in installing these devices took delight in revealing what the devices could do to unsuspecting co-workers. Such as flopping the picture fed to a monitor, either vertically or horizontally. When the co-worker would exclaim in surprise what they had seen, the picture would them be flipped back before they could bring it to someone's attention.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/dve%20effects.jpg
Two channels of DVE. Today trivial, then it took hundreds of thousands of dollars to pull off

Previously, the content of a picture could only be composed of layered elements, principally keys and backgrounds. Digital technology, namely the creative use of computer memory, enabled the active picture to be resized and repositioned. Vital was not alone for long.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ampex%20ess.jpg

Ampex, the video tape folks, while pushing VTR technology along, had also designed and built their own TBCs, as Sony was doing, to support their VTRs. Thus they were cultivating digital video engineering and design. In 1977 they came out with the Electronic Still Store or ESS. At that time if a broadcaster wanted to show a still photo, either they needed a slide projector as part of a film chain or they had a video camera shoot a card on an easel. ESS combined the frame sync with computer high density storage to produce an electronic slide projector. Seems trivial today. Was not then. It also could record and playback sequences of video frames forwards and backwards at varying speeds. Again today, so what? Then, WOW!

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/ampex%20ado%20cp.jpg

A year later Ampex introduced the first video paint system with a tablet and pen that allowed graphic artists to paint on an electronic canvas. Then a year after the Squeezezoom debuts Ampex launches the Ampex Digital Optics or ADO, a DVE, that while a year later then the Squeezezoom, was a full generation more advanced. It was the start of a DVE progeny, that would greatly affect the Group when they got serious about building their own DVE.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/coke%20can.jpg
Soon Ampex had advanced from not only doing 2D moves and effects, but full 3-D, including page turns and mapping onto solid objects. At a NAB in the mid-80s Ampex demonstrated the effect of taking a flat Coke can graphic and rolling it up into a can shape. Ampex started offering the ADO that could manipulate and combine multiple sources at once.

When Vital and Ampex were launching their DVEs respectively, the Group decided to OEM a DVE that NEC had launched. The only electronics the Group added was the control panel and its interface. While it had the Groups touch and feel, the bulk of the sales revenue went to NEC and not the Group.

When the Group finally got serious in 1984 about creating their own DVE, what eventually became known as the Kaleidoscope, shortened usually to just Kscope, the design team was given carte blanch to develop the best box they could. An immediate problem that cropped up was that the control group was at Bitney Springs while the video processing group was at the airport. The company had not quite figured out whose product it would be, PSD or BSD. Another problem was that Ampex had already boxed the Kscope design in with patents. To get around some of that the designers ended up having to throw a lot of additional hardware at the problem.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/kscope%20cp.jpg
Kscope control panel

While the Group had experience with digital circuits to control things this was its first digital video project. While the company did bring new grads in that had exposure to treating video as digital numbers, it also brought in a number of engineers from the BBC. The British were generally leading the way, followed by Sony, in digital video technology. None-the-less, there was a steep learning curve. Video processing is quite different in the digital realm. Whereas analog video filters consisted of inductors, and capacitors, and maybe some active components, filtering in the digital domain was done in banks of shift registers with varying amounts of recursive feedback. Digital Signal Processing, or DSP as it is known.

The other thing that made this more doable as the group's first digital video project was that it simply took in analog composite video, sampled it at about 13 MHz/sec, and then performed whatever magic was required. But simply doing this did not alleviate the inherent problems of mixing the black and white information with the color information, which composite video was. Even at this time there was a better analog way of handling the color and black and white information. It was known as component video. The color and black & white information were kept separate, and therefore did not interact with each other. The BBC and Sony were already working on systems that did the same digitally. The group was slower than most to digital, and as we will see slow to embrace component digital over composite digital.

All the hardware thrown at the goal made each channel of the Kscope DVE about 20 rack units high (about a yard), and each channel consumed 1600 watts of power. The cables from the power supply to the backplane motherboard for each channel were double aught battery cables. The Kscope was forced to use super-fast TTL and some ECL logic. To keep the size of the boards semi-reasonable, and to minimize propagation and timing issues the boards were exceedingly dense with components. Birney Dayton pointed the designers to Intergraph, who had a point to point wiring system from Kollmorgen (KM). Multi-layer boards were in their infancy at that point. The KM Machine would make as many layers as needed. It would stitch wires across the board, the wires were insulated. It walked across boards, daisy chaining connections and Electro bonding each connection. It hooked up a wire and welded it to the pad at the other end. The whole process was much like vector plotting. Intergraph ended up manufacturing the Kscope's boards.

A novel idea the group came up with was to be able to have multiple control stations, with each able to take control and use one or more channels. The system control was designed to control up to eight channels. Each channel had the equivalent processing of 16 of the most powerful processors of the day. With all that the Kscope could never quite duplicate the ADO's Coke can effect.

Another issue was the frame itself. It was designed using off the shelf aluminum studs, ribs, and tubing. Assembled much like an erector set. It became obvious to anyone who ever had to replace each channels cooling fans, there were 18 of them prone to failure, that the fans were the first items in the frame to be installed. This is because to replace fans the technician had to completely disassemble the frame into over 100 pieces of miscellaneous hardware. It could be disconcerting to see a $150,000 Kscope channel reduced to a stack of boards and a pile of aluminum parts.

The Kscope was introduced in 1986. The fact that Ampex had a five year head start, limited the Kscope sales. It was almost as capable from an effects standpoint as the ADO, and more capable as a facility wide system that could have channels of it assigned on the fly to different control rooms gave it a fighting chance. In reality the largest systems never had more than four channels.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/kadenza.jpg
Within a couple of years the Group redid the control panel for the Kscope so that it appeared like a normal production switcher panel. It was called the Kadenza. Both the Kscope and Kadenza were digital composite systems. Again that is video where the color, or chroma information and the monochrome or black and white information was mixed and processed together. The world was already leaning towards component, keeping the two sets of info separate. The bottom line was that component made for much better quality video.

An advancement with the Kadenza was that it would accept 8-bit parallel digital video directly into and out, whereas the Kscope only accepted analog video. With the ability to accept parallel digital video (thick cables with a pair of conductors for each of the 8 bits) Kadenza could be considered to be the Group's first digital switcher. But parallel digital video, with its thick cables never took off except in very niche situations.

The Kadenza was sort of a hybrid between a DVE and a switcher. It could combine up to five Kscope channels with conventional switching capabilities. Expanding on the multiple control panels accessing a common pool of channels, the Kadenza allowed a number of control panels to access any combination of channels. NBC used the Kadenza at the 1988 Olympics.

As mentioned the initial plan was to involve enough state of the art hardware, which was controlled by firmware, so that eventually the software would catch up and completely match or surpass the ADO. From the beginning the software folks ran most of the project, and in a few ways the hardware was not fully developed, it generally evolved based on the software groups perceived needs.

In 1989 the Groups second DVE entered service, the DPM-100 (Digital Picture Manipulator). It was geared for smaller markets and production situations and came with a greatly lower price. That year the Group introduced its last analog switcher, called the Diamond.

<h4>3000/4000 GVG&apos;s first Digital Switchers</h4>
While the Kadenza, in a way, was the Groups first digital switcher, it was really an outgrowth of the Groups first DVE, the Kscope. It was also meant to be a post-production switcher. In response to Sony's introduction of their DVS-7000 the Group went to work on a competitive project. To do this quickly and efficiently they took the Kscope architecture and interfaced it with a more traditional control panel.
***************Did all marquee switchers that followed all have built in DVEs?************************

Up until Sony entered the switcher fray, people thought GV was eclectic, now some customers were starting to think GV was just weird. A reason for this was that as mentioned the world was leaning towards component video, and Sony was the leading pioneer towards this path. Grass Valley, which was now at least thinking digital, still held on to what was known to them, composite video.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/preview/chapters/graphics/3000%20cp.jpg
First GVG "digital" switcher

The 3000 was a big step forward for the group as it no longer required the thick multi-conductor video cables, the digital video into and out of it traveled on a single coax cable, just like traditional analog video did. It was a clean sheet design and it was designed to directly take SMPTE259 signals, the standard definition Serial Digital Interface (SDI). But these were not the component digital flavor that the Sony 7000 handled, but composite digital signals. Whereas the Kadenza could take composite parallel signals, known as SMPTE244, the 3000 would handle composite SDI over a single coax cable. The SDI standard could handle both the 143 Mb/s composite, and the 270 Mb/s component signals. The higher bit rate that component consumed down the coax cable than composite did was an indication of the superior quality that component brought compared to composite.

High Frequencies

Today it is component video from camera to your home receiver. In the late 80s not all were sure that component would win the day. Many thought that like NTSC, and PAL analog formats, where chroma and monochrome are mixed together, would be a straighter approach forward. CBS, like GVG, took a contrarian approach to the concept of digital video and pushed for composite digital. CBS had vigorously fought against the original NTSC color approach in the early 50s. Now they had differing opinions on how digital should proceed. In fact in 1988 a standard for recording digital composite was issued, and that format became known as D2.

https://www.lomaricatv.com/tech%20boxes.html#d1d2
Digital component verses composite signals

When it came time to launch the 3000. Any hope that it would go smoother than the 300 launch proved to be wrong. A bit of the problem was that the Group still was not fully committed to digital, let alone, which flavor. The company was still contemplating another analog switcher, as that was its comfort zone. While digital video makes somethings easier, somethings it did not. The design of analog filters and mixers were not in the first category. Both composite and component reduce video to a number sequence. Often that meant that mixing and filtering often involved mathematical processes. The Group had to end up using ASICS (Application Specific ICs) in their design. An expensive and time consuming process. As already mentioned a problem GVG had in designing ASICs was that instead of the most advanced modeling tools they used tools that Tektronix already had.

While the 3000 was the first GVG switcher that employed multiple microprocessors, there was much disagreement with how they were being used in a hierarchical manner. Many thought from a processing standpoint the switcher ended up being under powered. This was born out after its launch as customers were not happy with the 2 to 3 frame delay for a source being selected on the control panel and the switcher actually cutting to it. This actually ended up hurting the production of a "People's Choice' award show that greatly angered CBS. Part of the problem was that some in the Group thought they were building a post-production switcher, and that the company was not talking to customers early on. As development went on the company needed to reposition the 3000 as their flagship offering. Something it could not do well. The market, and finally the Group itself realized that it was late to digital and had to deliver something competitive soon.

When the 3000 showed up at NAB in 1991 it required five hidden Compaq 386s to make it appear to work. The rouge worked well enough that a high-ranking Sony official looked at the switcher and exclaimed it was the switcher they should have built. Little did he know.

It turned into a software project the likes of which the Group had never seen before. There were 16 software engineers and only four hardware engineers working on it, Bruce Rayner, John Apt, Richard Bannister, and Brian Dunbar. Bannister had his hands full developing the ASICs that the switcher required. Sophia Day was the project manager. All the technical folks involved were surrounded by constraints stemming from waiting too long to realize where the industry was going. There were complaints that the project kept changing course, not only from management, but from the engineers involved also.

When the GVG 3000 shipped it was 95% complete. The problem was how do you deal with the 5% that's left with the customers staring over your shoulder? This is exactly what happened with the 300, and now the 3000. Sony now appeared to be the leader in the very area that had defined the Group. This was the first of the Grass Valley Company's nadirs.

Immediately the Group went back to the drawing board and went to work on the future, a clean sheet digital component switcher. They even had Dave Hershberger design the Groups own SDI transceiver chip set. Richard Bannister was this projects Program Manager. Bannister was a veteran of the hybrids, the 300, Kscope and Kadenza, and the 3000. While this project went far better than the 3000 it launched in 1992 with reliability problems.

The company was in dire straits from 1991 through 1993. In 1994 Tektronix sent down Dan Castles to straighten the situation out. He flew into San Francisco and got on a company plane for a 45 minute flight to Grass Valley. There was also another passenger on the flight. Dan asked his fellow traveler what was bringing him to visit the Group. He said he was with NBC in New York, and he said that he was going there to rip the current GV President a new asshole. Then he asked who Dan was. Dan said, "I'm Dan Castles, and I guess I'm getting a new asshole." NBC had committed to the 4000 switcher and it wasn't going to be ready as promised.

The next day at the meeting Dan said to the NBC guy, "We got an hour, here's all the people who are involved. If you want to go "New York" on them go ahead, but it won't make any difference." That settled the visitor down a bit, and he simply asked if it worked well enough to be shipped anyway. Engineering said it was at 95%.

For the first six months that the 4000 was being shipped, Dan apologized to customers and put action plans into place.

Fox was doing one of their first big events, the World Cup. They were doing a dry run for Rupert Murdoch, and as he walked in the switcher went down. If it had been a real show it would have been a disaster. So engineer John Gerowwas SP? was shipped back to babysit that switcher during that event. He couldn't do anything, but he was there for someone to beat up. 

Once the issues were fixed the 4000 became a very popular switcher. The Kalypso was the follow on to the 4000.

1200 - Last stand alone DVE *******************Year?*******************************8
Soon DVE's were no longer stand alone devices. They became a part of the switcher, as did the still store.

In the mid-90s Tektronix and the Group found itself defending too many market segments, and most of them not well. It was now facing increased competition in it&aois;s switcher, router, and as we will see a bit later, now in the video server markets. Both Tek's test equipment and the Groups video equipment had high capital development costs in hardware and in the user interface. Tek was starting to think it was not getting the return it wanted from Grass Valley. At one point there was even questions about if the Group was an asset in decline.
